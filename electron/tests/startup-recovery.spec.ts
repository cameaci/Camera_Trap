/**
 * End-to-end tests for the startup error page and its recovery buttons.
 *
 * These launch the real Electron app against a throwaway user data dir,
 * which spawns the real backend against a throwaway database. Nothing
 * here touches `~/AddaxAI`.
 *
 * What they are here to catch: when the backend refuses a database it
 * exits before the API or the frontend exist, so the in-app Restore and
 * Reset dialogs are unreachable and every part of the recovery path
 * runs in the main process instead. That path has no unit-testable
 * seam. It is a file the backend writes, a page the main process
 * renders from it, and two IPC handlers that write marker files the
 * backend consumes on the next launch. Only running the app proves the
 * pieces line up.
