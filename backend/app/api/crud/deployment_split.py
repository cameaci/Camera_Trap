"""
Split one deployment into N child deployments along the folder hierarchy.

Users occasionally kick off an analysis against a root folder that actually
contains several deployments-worth of subfolders. They end up with one
`Deployment` row covering data that should have been N rows, which breaks
the map, camtrap-dp export, and site filtering.

This module implements the split operation:
1. Compute target subfolders at a chosen descent depth (clamped per-branch).
2. Copy the parent's `.addaxai/projects/{project_id}/` artifacts (results.json
   slice, video_frames subtree) into each child subfolder.
3. Validate the copies on disk.
4. In a single DB transaction: create child `Deployment` rows, reassign files,
   reassign events (duplicating events that straddle multiple children), and
   delete the parent row.
5. Delete the parent's old `.addaxai` artifacts.

See DEVELOPERS.md for the related datetime / non-label / verified conventions
that this pipeline preserves unchanged.
