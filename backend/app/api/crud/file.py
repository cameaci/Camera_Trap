    - every detection that passes the project threshold, which is one
      card in the Crops tab, and
    - every file where nothing passes, which is one card in the Empties
      tab carrying the label "nothing here".

    The two never overlap and together they cover the project, because a
    file either has a passing detection or it does not. So this total is
    exactly the number of cards across both tabs, and 100% means every
    one of them has been looked at.

    That is what makes one bar work for a page with two halves, and what
    stops it reading 100% while the empty files are untouched. Counting
    files instead would have understated the crop work, since one file
    can carry several labels.

    The floor follows the grid's confidence slider, through the same
    ``effective_floor`` the two grids use, so this can never disagree
    with what is on screen beside it.

    It used to stay pinned to the project threshold, on the argument
    that a denominator moving while you drag would be unreadable. That
    was the wrong trade: the counts feed the chips on the tab switch,
    which sit next to grids that DO follow the slider, so at 1% the chip
    read "Empties 220" above a grid header saying "68 files". Two
    numbers for one thing on one screen is worse than a number that
    moves when you deliberately change what counts. The dashboard passes
    no slider, so its bar is unaffected either way.

    The two halves are returned separately as well as summed, so each
    tab can say how much is waiting in the other one. Site and date
    filters DO apply: they carry across the tab switch, so a count that
    ignored them would promise more than the user is about to see.

    Verifying a file says "the boxes you can see are all there is". So on
    the file's visible frame, every box the person could not see (below
    the threshold and not verified) is rejected the way the X key rejects
    a box (marked "false detection", verified), and every box they could
    see is verified. One rule for every file, empty or not, and for every
    box, whoever drew it: a drawn box has confidence 1.0, so it is always
    visible and never rejected.

    Rejecting the weak boxes rather than leaving them is what keeps
    "verified" true at every threshold: left alone, a 3% smudge came back
    the moment the confidence slider dropped, still under a verified
    flag. The rejected rows stay out of every user-facing scope through
    ``threshold_or_verified`` (`ml/label_exclusion.py`). They used to be
    deleted instead, which meant reprocess reported them as missing and
    nothing could ever bring them back; kept as rejected rows they match
    their ``results.json`` boxes again, and an unverify hands them back
    to the machine on the next reprocess.

    Scoped to the visible frame, which for a video is its best frame plus
    verified boxes on any frame. Boxes on frames nobody saw are neither
    rejected nor verified. A video with no best frame has no visible
    surface, so verifying it sets the flag and touches no boxes.

    Unverifying clears every box on the file, drawn ones included.

    Idempotent, so re-verifying picks up boxes added since. Both paths
    re-derive ``observation_type`` and the event MaxN, as the detection
    endpoints do. The caller commits.
