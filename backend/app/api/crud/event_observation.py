MaxN calculation and storage for event observations.

MaxN is the maximum number of individuals of a species visible in any
single image within an event. Calculated per-species, stored in the
event_observations table.

A row is one cohort (see the model). The AI seeds one row per species
with no demographics; a person labels that row in place or splits it.
The rebuild below carries all of that: see DEVELOPERS.md, "Observation
cohorts".

    Recalculate the AI-derived MaxN per species for a single event, while
    preserving the human-authoritative data layered on top.

    `prior` supplies the human layer to carry when the event was just
    (re)created and has no rows of its own yet, e.g. during an interval
    change where a deleted event's replacement covers the same files. When
    None, the event's own current rows are used (the normal relabel/verify
    path).

    Algorithm:
    1. Count detections per (file, frame, taxonomy) and take the maximum
       count per species (= MaxN). Ties break on summed confidence.
       For videos, a species only counts if it appears on the video's best
       frame (or was verified on some frame): non-best-frame labels are
       per-frame classifier noise the user can't see or clean in the Labels
       step, so they must not spawn spurious species rows.
    2. Rebuild the event's `event_observations` rows: one per AI species,
       carrying the human layer of that species' *seed* row (its
       human_count, sex, life stage and behaviour), plus every other
       human-only row (max_n=0, no frame) recreated as it was: the cohorts a
       person split off, and the species the AI did not detect this round.
    3. Clear `Event.confirmed` when the set of (species, demographics,
       count) changed (a Labels-page relabel/add/delete that moves a count
       un-signs the event); a pure detection-verify that leaves it unchanged
       does not.

    The seed of a species is its prior AI row (max_n > 0), else a human-only
    row without demographics (a species added by hand that the AI now finds
    merges into the AI row, as before). Species are keyed by
    `label_taxonomy_id or label` so the layer survives the delete-and-rebuild.

    Returns the rebuilt EventObservation rows.
