"""
Export CRUD — scoping query plus row / layer / CamTrap DP table builders.

The serializers in ``export_formats.py`` don't touch the DB; everything
here does. Row shapes line up 1:1 with the column orders declared in
``export_formats.py``.

Conventions
-----------

* ``Detection.confidence >= project.counting_threshold OR Detection.verified``
  is the user-facing filter (see DEVELOPERS.md "Detection threshold and
  verified override").
* ``Project.excluded_classes`` filters animal detections whose
  ``LabelTaxonomy.name`` matches (case-insensitive). Non-animal detections
  (person/vehicle) and files with zero in-scope detections survive so
  blank rows still fire.
* Observational datetimes (``File.captured_at_local``, ``Event.event_*_local``)
  are naive wall-clock values in ``Project.timezone`` and are formatted via
  ``to_local_iso_with_offset`` with an explicit timezone argument, so the
  formatted value carries a per-row UTC offset (DST-correct).

# Flat detections CSV. One row per detection (the box grain). Lean on
# attributes (no time / place / paths — join to files.csv for those), but
# carries the full set of FK ids (file_id, deployment_id, event_id) so it
# links directly to every parent table without chained joins. Mirrors
# Camtrap-DP, whose observations table carries deploymentID / mediaID /
# eventID together.
#
# Column order follows the pipeline: ids, the detector stage (category +
# score), the classifier stage (label + score), the label's taxonomy /
# names, then geometry, then the verified flag.
#
#   detection_id    — the detection row id.
#   file_id         — FK to files.csv (time, place, paths live there).
#   relative_path   — path inside the deployment folder, same value as
#                     files.csv. The one non-id column from the file, so a
#                     person reading this table in Excel can find the photo
#                     without a join (a beta tester could not).
#   deployment_id   — FK to deployments.csv (site, effort).
#   event_id        — FK to the event (also on files.csv).
#   detection_category — detector class: animal / person / vehicle.
#   detection_confidence — detector (MegaDetector) score for the box.
#   classification_label — the current species label, by model or human
#                     (provenance-neutral; see is_verified). Empty when
#                     nothing was classified (person, vehicle, unclassified).
#   classification_confidence — score for that label: the classifier's
#                     score, or 1.0 when a human assigned it.
#   ai_classification_label — the AI's final label (after geofence rollup
#                     and smoothing) = what the UI showed, kept even after
#                     a human relabel (so "AI said X, human changed to Y"
#                     is visible). Equals classification_label until a human
#                     changes it. The raw pre-rollup call is not exported;
#                     it stays in results.json. Empty for detector-only,
#                     person / vehicle, and pre-column detections.
#   ai_classification_confidence — the AI's score for that final call.
#   classification_method — who set the current label: machine or human.
#   is_verified     — this detection is human-verified (grouped with the
#                     label columns above so the provenance reads together).
#   taxon_*         — formal ranks from label_taxonomy; empty where the
#                     label has no (or partial) taxonomy.
#   frame_number    — video frame index; empty for images.
#   bbox_*          — normalized [0,1] box.
#
# Empty files do not appear here (a detections table holds detections);
# they live in files.csv. The per-event species count lives in counts.csv.

    layout; the label + ranks + names run is ``build_observation_rows``'.

    Both confidences are read off the same ``best`` object as the label, so
    they cannot describe a different box than the species does. Rounded to
    six places like ``_detection_cells``, so a value here compares equal to
    the same field of the same box in detections.csv.

    Gated to the file's visible surface, so for a video this is its best
    frame. That is the same rule ``observation_type`` beside it now uses,
    which is what keeps the whole block describing one box, and a box the
    user can actually open. The gate runs in Python rather than in
    ``get_scoped_detection_rows`` because that query is also shared with
    the CamTrap DP builder, which keeps every frame by design (an
    archival export must not lose a video whose best frame is empty).

    The threshold is passed explicitly even though ``get_scoped_detection_rows``
    already applied the same predicate in SQL. Re-applying it costs one pass
    over a handful of already-loaded objects and keeps these columns tied to
    the same threshold ``observation_type`` uses, so a later change to that
    query cannot silently desynchronise the two.

    Names come off the detection, not off the joined ``LabelTaxonomy``. That is
    the convention ``_detection_cells`` uses, so a Files row and its
    detections.csv rows read identically with no join. (The other convention in
    this module, ``_scientific_name``, blanks non-animals and reads the taxonomy

    - ``n_images`` / ``n_videos``: the files those rows sit on, by type.
    - ``n_events``: the events those files belong to.

      confirmed number where one was set, else the AI's MaxN).

    also why a species that only exists in the Counts table (added by hand

    the honest record, but it was not found, so it gets no Summary row.
    The Counts table skips it the same way.
