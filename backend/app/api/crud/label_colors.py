"""Species colours: one palette, assigned so related species differ most.

The Labels grid, the Counts page and the annotated JPEG export all
colour a detection by its species. The colours exist so a person
scanning a block of look-alike crops notices the odd one out, and that
only works when the species most likely to be confused for each other
sit far apart in colour. Two shades of green on two rodents is exactly
the failure this module prevents.

The rule:

1. Collect the species present in the project, the same population the
   label filter offers (threshold-or-verified, visible frame).
2. Sort them by taxonomy: class, order, family, genus, species, variant,
   then name. Siblings end up next to each other.
3. Walk ``SPECIES_PALETTE``: rank ``i`` gets ``SPECIES_PALETTE[i % 12]``.

The palette is ordered farthest-first, so any two consecutive entries
are far apart perceptually. Sorting siblings next to each other and then
walking that order is what gives them the most contrasting colours.
Species 13 onwards share a colour with the species twelve ranks away,
which is almost never a relative.

Why not hash the label, as before: with ten species present and any
fixed number of colours, two of them land on the same or a neighbouring
colour almost every time (the birthday problem). Only looking at which
species are present avoids that. The cost is that colours are per
project and can shift when a new species appears.

This is the only implementation. The frontend fetches the map from
``GET /api/projects/{id}/label-colors`` and the export reads it through
``_visualisation_style.detection_color``, so the JPEG on disk always
matches the grid on screen.
