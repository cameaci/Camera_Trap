"""
Pydantic schemas for the CSV bulk imports (sites and deployment queue).

Both imports share one wire shape so the frontend renders their previews and
their problem lists with one component.

A note on `CsvImportProblem.message`: it must be a CONSTANT string. The
offending cell goes in `value`, never inside the message. The dialog groups
problems by message to collapse "40 rows have the same mistake" into one
line, and an interpolated message cannot group.
