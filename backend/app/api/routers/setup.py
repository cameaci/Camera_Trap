"""
First-run setup endpoints.

The desktop app is gated by a one-time setup wizard on first launch.
Setup has two parts: install env-addaxai-base via micromamba, and
download the default model weights (MDv5A + DINOv2-S) from HuggingFace.
Both run in a background thread driven by POST /api/setup/install-env;
the wizard polls /api/setup/status at ~1.5s and watches progress.

Polling rather than WebSocket: this is a one-shot UI staring at a
single progress bar for 10-30 minutes, polling at 1.5s costs nothing
and keeps the implementation small.

Module-level state intentionally resets when the server restarts: a
restart while installing is treated as "no install in progress", and
the user clicks Install again. Both the env manager and the HF
downloader are idempotent and resume safely.
