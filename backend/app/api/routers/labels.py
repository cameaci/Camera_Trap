"""
Labels API router.

Drives the Labels verify tab: embedding-based sort, nearest-neighbor
search, and embedding coverage stats. Heavy computation is delegated to
ml/inference/similarity_script.py via subprocess (no numpy/faiss needed here).
The "similarity" name on internal modules reflects the underlying technique;
user-facing surfaces are named after the unit of work, the label.
