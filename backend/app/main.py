    # Unhandled-exception middleware. Without this, an unhandled
    # exception flows up to starlette's default ServerErrorMiddleware,
    # which sits OUTSIDE CORSMiddleware in the stack. The 500 it
    # generates ships without `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, and the
    # renderer (which treats `localhost:8000` and `127.0.0.1:8000` as
    # cross-origin) reports the response as `TypeError: Failed to
    # fetch`, hiding the real status code and making diagnostics
    # painful. Registering a FastAPI `@app.exception_handler(Exception)`
    # does NOT fix this: Starlette's build_middleware_stack routes
    # Exception/500 handlers to ServerErrorMiddleware (also outermost).
    #
    # The middleware below must be added BEFORE CORSMiddleware.
    # add_middleware inserts each new entry at the front of
    # `user_middleware`, then the stack is built by wrapping that list
    # in reverse, so the first-registered middleware ends up innermost.
    # We want exception-handling to be inside CORS so the 500 response
    # it produces gets the CORS header on the way out.
