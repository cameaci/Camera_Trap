"""
Database backups: rolling daily snapshots, pre-upgrade snapshots, and
manual snapshots driven by the user.

Snapshots use SQLite's online backup API (`sqlite3.Connection.backup`),
which is WAL-safe and produces a single consolidated `.db` file with
no `-wal` / `-shm` siblings.

Storage layout under `~/AddaxAI/backups/`:
- `addaxai-<utc-iso>.db`                        — daily rolling snapshot
- `addaxai-pre-upgrade-<rev>-<utc-iso>.db`      — pre-upgrade snapshot
- `addaxai-pre-restore-<utc-iso>.db`            — safety snapshot before a restore
- `addaxai-manual-<utc-iso>[-<note>].db`        — user-initiated "back up now"
- `.last-rolling-utc-date`                      — daily-throttle marker

Manual backups may carry an optional user note, slugged into the
filename (lowercase a-z, 0-9, hyphens). The filename is the only place
the note lives, so it travels with the file to external drives and
needs no sidecar state. One consequence: app versions older than the
note feature do not match the noted filename and will not list such a
backup in their restore picker; it stays restorable there via the
"Restore from a file" escape hatch.

Each automatic kind keeps its own rolling ring of the 5 newest (daily,
pre-upgrade, pre-restore): they are full DB copies, so unbounded
accumulation is wasted disk, and older ones span schema versions you
can't roll back across anyway. Manual "back up now" files are the
user's deliberate action and are never auto-pruned. The filename prefix
is what lets the restore UI label each snapshot by kind. Backups the
user saves to their own folder are not listed here and are theirs to
manage.
