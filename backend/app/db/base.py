# The one index whose ANALYZE statistic has to be thrown away again.
#
# `files.source_video_id` is the only self-referencing foreign key in the
# schema (frame rows point at the video they came from) and it declares
# ON DELETE CASCADE, so SQLite consults `idx_files_source_video` once for
# every `files` row it deletes.
#
# ANALYZE writes one row per index whether anything uses it or not. For
# this one it writes "<n> <n>", because the column is NULL on every file
# that is not a video frame, so a lookup "matches" the whole table. SQLite
# 3.45, which the packaged build carries, reads that and stops using the
# index: the per-row cascade lookup becomes a full scan of all 380k index
# entries, once per deleted row. Deleting a project of 369,298 files went
# from 4 seconds to an estimated 6.5 hours that way, and deleting a
# deployment, deleting a folder run and re-running one all pay the same.
#
# Dropping the statistic costs nothing. No query searches by
# `source_video_id`: the two places that read it either project it
# (`crud/label_tree.py`) or join by `files.id` (`joinedload(File.source_video)`),
# and EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN gives both the same plan with the row and without
# it. A query that did search by it is *helped*: with the row present the
# planner answers `SCAN files`, without it `SEARCH files USING INDEX
# idx_files_source_video`.

    and destroyed user verifications on 2026-05-27.

    1. `ensure_upgradable` refuses a database alembic cannot be trusted

    2. `alembic upgrade head` applies whatever is pending. On a fresh

    3. `schema_problems` checks the result against the models. Anything
       missing means the stamp lied, so we stop rather than guess.
    4. Seed builtin labels and refresh planner statistics.

    Raises `SchemaError` (message written for the end user) when the
