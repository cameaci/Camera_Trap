"""
HuggingFace Repository Downloader with Multi-threading.

Adapted from streamlit-AddaxAI's proven downloader.
Optimized multi-threaded downloader for HuggingFace model repositories with:
- Adaptive worker scaling based on connection speed
- Progress tracking via callbacks
- Per-file retries, and a skip for files already complete on disk, so a
  retried repo download only fetches what is still missing. There is no
  resume within a file: an interrupted file restarts from byte 0.
- Thread-safe progress updates

Following DEVELOPERS.md principles:
- Crash early if downloads fail
- Explicit error messages
- Type hints everywhere
