"""
Classification postprocessing service.

Applies event smoothing and taxonomic rollup to classification results
using MegaDetector's classification_postprocessing module. Reads raw
predictions from JSON files and writes smoothed results back to the DB.

The actual smoothing runs as a subprocess in the ML environment because
megadetector is only installed there, not in the backend environment.
