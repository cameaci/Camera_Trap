"""
Build a synthetic MegaDetector-format JSON for full-image classifiers.

Full-image classifiers (e.g. AHDRIFT-v1) label the whole frame with a
single class and do not need a detector to run first. The downstream
classification pipeline still expects detections in MegaDetector's
standard JSON shape, so this module synthesises one full-image detection
per image (bbox covering the entire frame, conf 1.0, category "1" /
animal). Once written, the JSON flows through the regular Phase 4 - 8
path unchanged: classify, merge, DB load, postprocessing, embedding.
