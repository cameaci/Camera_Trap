"""
Custom Classification Model with One-Shot Batch Subprocess.

Runs classification_worker.py as a one-shot subprocess: parent writes all
detections to a temp JSON file, subprocess classifies everything, writes
results to output JSON, exits. No persistent process, no stdin/stdout protocol.

Created by Claude Code on 2026-01-05
Updated on 2026-03-14 - Simplified from persistent worker to one-shot batch

        Classify a batch of detections in a one-shot subprocess.

        Args:
            items: List of items in the worker's discriminated-union shape:
                  `{"source": "image", "image_path": ..., "bbox": ...}` or
                  `{"source": "video", "video_path": ..., "frame_number": ...,
                    "bbox": ..., "detection_conf": ...}`.
            best_frame_outputs: Map `{video_path: destination_directory}`.
                The worker fuses best-frame scoring into the same pass
                that classifies video detections, and writes one JPEG per
                video into the supplied directory. Blank videos (no items
                of source=video) still get scored if listed here.
            scoring_detections: Map `{video_path: [{"frame_number", "conf",
                "bbox"}, ...]}` of every detection on that video, all
                categories. This is what best-frame scoring runs on.
                `items` cannot serve: it holds only animals above the
                classification gate, so a person-only clip would score
                nothing and fall back to an arbitrary frame. Required, and
                sent even when empty: the worker refuses a payload with
                videos but no key, because that means the caller is running
                older code than the worker it just spawned.
            batch_size: Number of crops processed per batch. None means let the
                classification worker use its own default (auto-detects GPU).
                A non-None integer is the user's Custom override.
            progress_callback: Optional callback(current, total) for progress updates
            device_callback: Optional callback(device) fired once, as soon as
                the worker reports which device it loaded on, so the UI can
                show the classifier's real device during the phase instead of
                whatever device the previous phase reported.

        Returns:
            Tuple of (results, class_names, compute_device, best_frames) where:
            - results: List parallel to items, ClassificationResult or None per item
            - class_names: Dict mapping class ID (str) to class name (str)
            - compute_device: Friendly device name (e.g., "GPU (Apple Silicon)")

              video the worker successfully scored.
