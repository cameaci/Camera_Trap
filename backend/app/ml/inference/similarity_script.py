"""
Standalone similarity script — runs as subprocess in env-addaxai-base.

Performs greedy nearest-neighbor similarity sort or FAISS nearest-neighbor
search on detection embeddings stored in a SQLite database. No app imports
— uses only stdlib plus numpy and faiss-cpu.

Usage:
    python similarity_script.py \
        --db-path /path/to/addaxai.db \
        --project-id <uuid> \
        --operation sort \
        --params '{"filters": {...}}'

Output: NDJSON event stream on stdout. Each line is one of:
    {"type": "progress", "phase": "load|sort|neighbors", "done": N, "total": M}
    {"type": "result", "detections": [...], "total_detections": N,
     "total_loaded": N, "total_matching": N}
    {"type": "error", "message": "..."}

Exit code: 0 on success (with a "result" line), non-zero on unhandled
errors (an "error" line is still emitted before exit). Streaming via
NDJSON keeps progress reporting on a single channel; the parent service
just relays lines to the HTTP client.

Following CONVENTIONS.md: crash early and loudly, no silent failures.
