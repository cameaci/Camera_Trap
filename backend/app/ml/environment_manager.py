        catches envs whose `python.exe` file survived but whose stdlib
        was pruned: Windows Defender quarantining `Lib/encodings/`,
        antivirus / Storage Sense cleanup, partial copy, interrupted
        rename, etc. Without this probe, the env reports "valid" right
        up until a worker subprocess crashes with

        The probe imports the stdlib C extension modules (the `.pyd`
        files in `DLLs\\` on Windows) rather than only `sys`, because
        antivirus quarantines those individually while interpreter boot
        stays intact. Seen in the field 2026-08: an env whose
        `select.pyd` and `unicodedata.pyd` were gone passed the old
        probe and then failed every analysis on tqdm's
        `from unicodedata import ...`.
