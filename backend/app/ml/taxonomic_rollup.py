    Walks species, family, order, class (skips genus); the species
    level counts only when an included class backs that exact chain,

    banned whole species still falls to family.

    **Path B (confidence rollup)**: top-1 is allowed but confidence
    < ``threshold``. Roll up to the nearest level above ``threshold``.
    Walks genus, family, order, class.

    Both paths use only the top-5 predictions for summing (matching
    the official SpeciesNet classifier which returns top-5 only).
