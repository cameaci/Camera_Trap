"""
Best-frame selection for video files.

Two code paths can produce a best frame per video:

1. **Fused with classification.** The classifier worker already iterates
   the source video to crop and classify each animal detection, so it
   picks the winning frame in the same pass and writes the JPEG itself.
   This is the common case and lives in
   `app/ml/inference/classification_worker.py`.

2. **No classifier configured.** This module covers that case: it opens
   each video itself, decides the frame from the detection JSON alone,
   fetches exactly that frame, and writes the JPEG.

Both paths score **every detection, whatever its category**, on the
detector's own confidence, and hand the result to
`scoring.pick_best_candidate` with the same tier rules. So a
classifier-on and a classifier-off run pick the same frame for the same
video.

That was not true until 2026-07-31: path 1 scored only the animals it was
about to classify, so a clip containing only people scored nothing and
fell back to sharpness over three arbitrary frames, while path 2 scored
the people. Detection confidence is the one signal every detector emits,
which is why it is the primary score: no category vocabulary is assumed,
so a detector emitting `fish` / `shark` / `turtle` needs no change here.

Created 2026-02-13. Rewritten 2026-05-13 to drop bulk frame extraction.
Fetching switched from a sequential walk to a verified seek 2026-08-03.

    Return `(best_frame_number, pixels)` for one video, or None if
    nothing decoded (`open_video` logs why).

    The frame is decided from the JSON before any pixels are touched, so
    we can go straight to it. Seeking is 3x cheaper than walking there,
    and it matters most for the commonest case: a video with no confident
    detection is sent to its middle frame, so walking meant decoding half
    of every empty clip and discarding it.

    A seek that cannot be verified falls back to the sequential walk,
    which also collects frame 0 as insurance. If the chosen frame never
    arrives (containers over-report their frame count) we return frame 0
    instead **and move the number with the pixels**. Stamping the frame
    we wanted while returning the frame we got is what makes the Labels
    grid draw one moment's boxes over another moment's picture.
