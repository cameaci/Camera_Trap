"""Folder-run tabular XLSX output.

One workbook with three sheets, Summary, Files and Detections — the same
three tables as the folder-run CSV export, in one file. A folder run is "run
AI without ecological interpretation", so the projects-mode sheets
(Deployments, Counts) are intentionally absent. The sheets wrap the
shared ``export_crud`` builders and are trimmed to the same column set
as the folder-run CSVs; see ``_table_columns`` for which columns and
why.

Writes ``<target_dir>/addaxai-spreadsheet.xlsx``.
