"""Compute a preview of what the Save outputs step will produce.

The Save step renders a folder-tree preview next to the option
controls so the user can see, before committing, the taxonomic
nesting that the run will produce, how multi-species placement
inflates the total, and how their species exclusion filter trims
it.

This module mirrors the placement logic in
``separate_folders._folder_for_file`` exactly: same threshold, same
main-species choice, same fallback folder, same observation-type
folder names, same exclusion semantics. The numbers it returns are
the same numbers the real postprocess run will produce.

The placement counts and byte totals are exact. ``by_media_tree`` is the
full on-disk tree for the chosen ``group_by`` + ``species_last``: the
species / observation folder and the preserved source subfolder combined
in the order the run writes them (path -> count). A capped ``root_files``
sample lists any loose files that land at the output root (only the "No
subfolders" mode with files at the source root).

Computation is three SELECTs: files, labelled detections, the
LabelTaxonomy chain for the project's classification model. The
Python loop after them is linear in (files + detections). Cheap
enough to call on every form change.

Disk size comes from ``File.size_bytes`` which is populated by the
ingestion step. Files with NULL size are excluded from the byte
total; the response surfaces both the byte total and the count of
files contributing to it so the UI can clarify when the estimate
is partial.
