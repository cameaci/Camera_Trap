"""Shared label-exclusion filter for the Save-outputs step.

Every postprocess module follows the same rule when the user has
picked an exclusion set in the Save step's filter card:

- The filter is label-level. The exclusion set is a heterogeneous
  list of identifiers: each entry is either a ``LabelTaxonomy.id``
  (UUID, for labels that have a taxonomy mapping) or a raw
  ``Detection.label`` string (for labels that don't). The
  frontend's label-tree modal emits both kinds — UUIDs for mapped
  leaves, raw names for the "Other" branch.
- A detection is excluded when its ``label_taxonomy_id`` is in the
  set OR its ``label`` string is in the set.
- A file with ALL its passing *identified* detections excluded is
  dropped entirely. A file with some excluded and some included
  identified detections survives, but only the included labels
  contribute to placements / EXIF tags / rows.
- "Identified" means the detection carries a label or a
  ``label_taxonomy_id``. Person and vehicle detections carry the
  builtin person / vehicle taxonomy id (see ``ensure_builtin_labels``),
  so they ARE filterable: deselecting Person in the Save-step filter
  drops person files from the media copies. Unclassified-animal
  detections carry the builtin "animal" id and are filterable the
  same way.
- True blanks (no identified detection at all) are never dropped by
  the filter; the Save step's "copy empties" toggle governs those.

Centralising the logic here keeps the seven postprocess modules
(separate, visualise, blur, exif, csv, xlsx, recognition_json) in
sync: changing the rule means changing one module, not seven.
