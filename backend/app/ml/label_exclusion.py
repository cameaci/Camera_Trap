"""
Label exclusion and non-label skip logic.

Two separate concerns handled here:

1. **User exclusion** (filter): labels the user marked as not present
   in their project area are removed from the classification list.
   Remaining confidences keep their raw values (no renormalization).
   This changes which label is assigned to a detection.

2. **Non-label skip** (DB gatekeeper): if the top-1 prediction after
   user filtering is a NON_LABEL_CLASS (blank, bait, etc.), the
   detection is not loaded to the database at all. The bbox is treated
   as a false positive.

These two steps are independent. JSON files on disk remain untouched
as raw ground truth.
