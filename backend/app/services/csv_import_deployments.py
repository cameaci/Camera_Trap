Deployment CSV import: parsing and validation.

What this creates is a `DeploymentQueue` entry, not a `Deployment`. The
deployment row itself is built later by the detection worker when the queue
runs, which is also where the capture dates come from. That is why the CSV
has no date columns and must never grow any.

Same split as the site importer: `parse_deployment_csv` is pure,
`validate_deployment_rows` is everything that has to be true at the moment of
writing, and both routes call the second one.

    A path holding a space has to be quoted in a shell, so people quote it in

    which csv.reader already consumes, but a single quote is an ordinary
    character to CSV and survives into the path, which is then never found.

    The two ends are handled separately rather than as a matching pair,
    because a spreadsheet usually destroys the pair: a **leading apostrophe
    is Excel's "treat this as text" marker**, so typing '/data/cam 1' into a
    cell stores /data/cam 1' and exports only the closing quote. Google
    Sheets does the same. Requiring a pair therefore fails on the single
    commonest way this reaches us.

    The trade this makes: a folder whose name really ends in a quote, say
    /data/Rangers', now imports as /data/Rangers and is reported as missing.
    Accepted, because a quote is an illegal filename character on Windows and
    such a name is vanishingly rare next to how often a spreadsheet does the
    above.

    The folder column only. Shell quoting is a habit about paths, and a site
    name that really contains quotes is likelier than a path that does.

    Deliberately does NOT un-escape backslashes, which is the other artifact
    (dragging a folder into a terminal gives `Kifaru\\ Plains`). A backslash
    is legal in a POSIX filename, so un-escaping could silently point the
    import at a different folder. Those rows keep failing as not found.
