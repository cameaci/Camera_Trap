"""
Shared event-clustering primitive.

One source of truth for how AddaxAI groups files into events. Both
`generate_events_for_project` (which writes Event rows for the UI) and
`build_smoother_input` (which packages the same groupings for the
MegaDetector smoothing subprocess) call `cluster_files_into_events` here.

Rule: bucket files by folder, then within each folder start a new event
whenever the time gap between consecutive files exceeds
`independence_interval`. Folder bucketing keeps events from bridging
across SD cards when a user runs a mixed backlog as a single
deployment. Time gaps handle the standard independence-interval rule
from camera-trap literature.

Paired cameras (`Deployment.paired_cameras`) invert the folder rule: the
subfolders are dependent cameras, so all files go in one bucket and an
animal seen by more than one camera lands in one event. The caller
passes the flag; this module never reads the deployment itself.

    off, clusters never span different folders either; with it on, the
    deployment's subfolders are one camera and files cluster across them.
    The flag has no default on purpose: every caller states which
    deployment semantics it wants.
