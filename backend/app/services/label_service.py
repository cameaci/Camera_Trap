"""
Labels service — subprocess dispatcher for the Labels verify tab.

Delegates sort (greedy nearest-neighbor chain), search (FAISS k-NN), and
cohort grouping (descendant-promotion review panel) to
ml/inference/similarity_script.py running in the addaxai-base conda
environment. The main backend process never imports numpy or faiss.

The subprocess emits NDJSON events on stdout (progress, result, error).
This module exposes:

- `stream_labels_subprocess(...)` — generator yielding raw NDJSON
  bytes lines for the streaming router endpoints to relay verbatim.
- `sort_detections` / `search_similar` — non-streaming convenience
  wrappers that drain the stream and return only the final result.
  Used by tests and any caller that doesn't care about progress.

The subprocess script is named for the underlying algorithm (cosine
similarity); this service is named for the feature it serves (the
Labels tab).
