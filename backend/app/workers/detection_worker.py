Detection and classification worker for deployment analysis jobs.

Following DEVELOPERS.md principles:
- Crash early if configuration invalid
- Explicit error handling
- Type hints everywhere

Updated to use new ML pipeline (detection → classification).

    that would send the websocket frame was the loop it was blocking.
