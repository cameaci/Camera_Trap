"""Tests for app.ml.json_utils, with a focus on tolerating failed-video
entries written by MegaDetector's process_video when a video can't be
decoded (corrupt file, unsupported codec, no retrievable frames).

A failed-video entry looks like:

    {
        "file": "video.mp4",
        "frame_rate": -1.0,
        "frames_processed": [],
        "failure": "Failure processing video: Error: found no frames in ...",
        "detections": null
    }

Naive `.get("detections", [])` returns None (not []) when the key is
present with value None, so iteration crashes with TypeError. These
tests pin the defensive iteration that fixes that.
