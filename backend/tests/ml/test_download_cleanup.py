"""
Tests for what a model download leaves behind when it does not complete.

Two rules, and the split between them is the whole point:

- A **failed** download leaves everything alone. Files land at their final
  path only once complete and size-verified, so a retry fetches what is
  missing instead of starting over.
- A **cancelled** download throws the downloaded files away, because the
  user asked it to stop, but keeps `manifest.json`.

`manifest.json` is what makes both rules matter. It is written from
models.json by the catalog updater, no HF repo ships one, so a download can
delete it and nothing short of the next launch's sync puts it back. Losing
it drops the model out of the catalog, which surfaces far from here as
"Classification model '<id>' not found" when a project is created.
