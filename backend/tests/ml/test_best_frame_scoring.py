"""Best-frame selection scores every detection, whatever its category.

Until 2026-07-31 the classifier-fused path scored the best frame from the
population it was about to classify, which `extract_animal_detections`
restricts to category "1" above the classification gate. Two consequences:

1. A clip containing only people or only vehicles scored nothing, so the
   picker fell through to "sharpest of three evenly-spaced frames" and
   chose with no idea where the subject was. Combined with the grid only
   showing best-frame detections, such a video could end up showing no
   cards at all.
2. The same video got a different best frame depending on whether a
   classifier was configured, because the no-classifier path in
   `best_frame.py` always scored every category.

Detection confidence is the one signal every detector emits, so scoring on
it is a single rule that holds for any detector/classifier combination and
assumes no category vocabulary. A detector emitting `fish` / `shark` /
`turtle` needs no change.
