"""Tests for the certificate-revocation failure and its opt-out.

Windows schannel refuses a certificate whose revocation status it cannot
establish. On a network that inspects TLS this kills every environment
build before a single package is read, and the raw micromamba output
names nothing the user can act on. These tests pin the one failure we
translate into an actionable error, and the marker file that is the only
way to skip the check.

The failure itself is Windows-only and cannot be produced on a developer
machine, so the detection is driven with the exact text a real run
emitted (reported 2026-08-14) rather than by provoking it.
