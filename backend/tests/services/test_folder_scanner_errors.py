"""An unreadable folder must never be reported as an empty one.

``os.walk`` defaults to ``onerror=None``, which discards every error
``os.scandir`` raises and yields nothing for that directory. A folder the
app cannot list then looks exactly like a folder with no media in it, and
every caller says "0 images".

That is what a beta tester hit on an external USB drive: the same path
answered "0 images, 0 videos" and then "8969 images" sixteen seconds
later, with `[Errno 5] Input/output error` on that drive elsewhere in the
same logs. The dangerous half was not the preview, it was the analysis
worker sharing the flaw: a stalled drive there means ingesting part of a
deployment and reporting success.

These tests make the folder unreadable with ``chmod 000`` and assert the
error comes out rather than being rounded down to zero.
