"""A previous run's output folder must never be re-ingested as input.

The folder-run save step writes separated / annotated copies into an
output folder (default: a subfolder of the source) and drops an
OUTPUT_DIR_MARKER there. Both the preview scan and the analysis worker's
input enumeration must skip any folder carrying that marker — otherwise a
re-run reprocesses the prior output (the copies have no EXIF, so they
surface as "no capture timestamp", and missing ones error out).

Regression test: the preview scanner and the worker scanners had drifted
(only the preview skipped output folders), which let output media get
reprocessed.
