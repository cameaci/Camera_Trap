"""Tests for `app.db.migrations` and the init_db flow.

`alembic_version` is ground truth. The app runs `alembic upgrade head`
and then checks the result against `Base.metadata`; it never guesses a
revision and never re-stamps backwards to replay the chain, because that
replay re-ran one-time data migrations over already-migrated data and
destroyed user verifications on 2026-05-27.

So the assertions here are: the chain from base produces exactly the
schema the models declare, `schema_problems` notices each way that can
fail, and every database the app refuses is left untouched.
