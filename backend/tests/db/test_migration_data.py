"""What the data migrations do to real rows.

`test_migrations.py` proves the chain builds the right *schema*. It runs
against an empty database, so every `UPDATE` and `DELETE` in the chain
matches zero rows there and their correctness is never exercised. This
module is the other half: it seeds the data shape each migration was
written to handle, runs that one migration, and checks what the rows
became.

That matters more than it sounds. A wrong data migration leaves the
schema matching the models perfectly, so the startup schema check waves
it through; the only symptom is a user whose verification work is
quietly wrong.

**Adding a data migration?** Add a test here. The recipe is the same
every time, and there are six worked examples below:

    upgrade_to("<the revision before yours>")   # the input schema
    ...insert rows with insert_row()...          # the data shape
    upgrade_to("<your revision>")                # one step
    ...assert what the rows became...

Raw SQL throughout, never the ORM factories in `tests/conftest.py`.
Those describe the schema at head; these tests write into the schema as
it was, where the columns are different.
