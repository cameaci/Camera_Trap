"""Marking a detection false takes it out of what a file is about.

"Mark false" on the Labels page writes the label ``false detection`` and
deliberately leaves the detector's ``category`` alone, because the
category is the detector's own word and is never translated. It also
verifies the box, and a verified box always passes the threshold.

Those two facts together used to make a rejected box the file's subject:
the file exported ``observation_type = animal`` with
``classification_label = false detection`` beside it, and the Counts page
grew an observation called "false detection" with a MaxN of 1. A thing
the user had just declared not real became a species with a count.

The AI's own non-label calls never reach the database at all; the ingest
skip drops them (DEVELOPERS.md, "Non-label detection skip"). These tests
pin the same rule at read time, which is the only place it can be applied
when a human reaches that verdict later.

The row itself is kept, not deleted. A human looked at that box and
judged it, which is worth recording, keeps undo working, and keeps
``detections.csv`` honest about what the detector found and what was
rejected.
