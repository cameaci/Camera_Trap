"""Verify the CORS allow-list follows the configured API port.

The Electron app picks the backend port (ADDAXAI_BACKEND_PORT) and passes
it to the backend as API_PORT, so the renderer is served from whatever
port the backend bound. CORS origins pinned to a literal 8000 stopped
matching as soon as the port moved, which is exactly the case this
setting exists to support.

Preflight is answered by CORSMiddleware itself, so these never reach a
route and need no database.
