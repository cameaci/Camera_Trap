Patch the 23 broken rows in the taxonomies that shipped before the port.

Targeted on purpose. Regenerating these files wholesale would rewrite
thousands of rows that are already correct just to fix a couple, and most
of them were hand-authored with no legacy source to regenerate from. So
each correction is written out and every other row is left untouched.

Two defect classes, both found by auditing all 15 shipped taxonomies:

  genus/species  The species column holds a full binomial whose genus
                 contradicts the genus column, so
                 format_scientific_name_from_taxonomy_row renders
                 "H. parahyaena brunnea". 19 rows.
  rank swap      class holds a GBIF order (squamata) with `reptilia`
                 below it in order. Wrong in both GBIF's backbone and
                 Linnaean terms. 4 rows.

This table is the wrong tool when a file is not merely wrong in places
but is the wrong file. See the PAM-SDZWA-v1 note below.

Not every odd-looking row is a defect:

  - `equus` + `zebra hartmannae` is a valid subspecies and renders
    "E. zebra hartmannae". Left alone.
  - `capra` + `aegagrus hircus` is the valid trinomial for the domestic
    goat, which GBIF happens not to carry. Left alone.
  - SPECIESNET-v4-0-2-A is not touched at all. Its `grizzly bear` row
    reads `ursus` + `u. arctos` and renders "U. u. arctos", which looks
    exactly like a mangled abbreviation, but it is what SpeciesNet itself
    publishes in taxonomy_release and in the labels file the model ships.
    Our taxonomy.csv is generated from that labels file by
    generate_taxonomy_csv.py, so "correcting" it here would diverge from
    upstream and be silently reverted the next time anyone regenerates.
    It is an upstream question, not ours.

    # copy of PAN-SDZWA-v1's Andes taxonomy, so the Amazon model was
    # described by the Andes model's species list, and correcting rows in
    # it only made the wrong file tidier. Its taxonomy.csv has since been
    # rebuilt from its own class list (Peru-Amazon_0.86.txt) through
    # resolve_taxonomy_gbif.py, which is a thing this table cannot
    # express: every row changed, not three.
