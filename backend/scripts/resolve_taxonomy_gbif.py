"""
Build a WebUI taxonomy.csv by resolving model class names against GBIF.

This is the single producer of taxonomy.csv for ported models. It runs at
staging time on a developer machine, never at runtime, so the GBIF calls
are not an app dependency.

Input: a CSV with a `model_class` column, local or an http(s) URL. Every
legacy taxon-mapping.csv qualifies as-is, in all three of the header
shapes the legacy repos publish.

Output (consumed by app.ml.taxonomic_rollup.load_taxonomy_lookup and
app.ml.taxonomy_db.populate_taxonomy_from_csv):

    model_class,class,order,family,genus,species

All values lowercase, empty when unknown. The species column holds the
name minus its leading genus, so "Panthera pardus" -> "pardus" and the
subspecies "Panthera pardus saxicolor" -> "pardus saxicolor". That
matches what is already shipped (see SAH-DRY-ADS-v1 and TKM-ADS-v1).

What gets asked, in order
-------------------------
Each row is resolved from the best evidence it carries. One rule, three
sources, first hit wins:

  1. `GBIF_usageKey` / `gbif_usage_key`  -> resolve the key directly.
     Authoritative when it works, and what the legacy CSVs were built
     from. A key is a hint, not a verdict: it falls through to 2 when it
     404s, when it is a negative sentinel, or when it resolves to a
     record carrying no lineage at all (some legacy keys point into a
     GBIF checklist rather than the backbone and come back with
     kingdom/class/order all null).

     The sentinels come from cls-training-pipeline: -1 for "not
     applicable or a mixed taxon", -10/-20/-30 for wolf/dog/dingo, whose
     lineage it hardcodes into the level_* columns instead. Falling
     through finds exactly that hardcoded answer.
  2. `scientific_name`, or the finest legacy `level_*` cell that carries
     a rank prefix   -> match that name against GBIF. Handles all three
     legacy header shapes, including the DeepForestVision file whose
     cells carry no prefixes at all.
  3. Nothing usable -> empty row, reported for review.

`model_class` itself is NEVER matched against GBIF. Model classes are
English common names and GBIF's matcher answers them badly: "aardvark"
comes back as kingdom Animalia, and "serval" matches a beetle genus
(Mordellidae) with an EXACT, full-confidence hit. Silently mislabelling a
serval as an insect is worse than leaving the row empty, so for a model
with no taxonomy at all, author a `scientific_name` column and feed that
in rather than relying on the class names.

Why GBIF and not the legacy level_* columns verbatim
----------------------------------------------------
When a key is present, GBIF is a strictly better source: the legacy cells
are a stale snapshot in three mutually incompatible shapes. Resolving the
326 keys of the Sub-Saharan model reproduces its hand-made, shipped
taxonomy.csv exactly, row for row, so the key path is known-good.

GBIF helps, the literature decides
----------------------------------
GBIF is a lookup, not the standard. Where its backbone disagrees with the
current literature, the literature wins and this script corrects it. Two
mechanisms, both explicit:

**ORDER_AS_CLASS.** GBIF's backbone has no Reptilia class: it places
Squamata, Testudines and Crocodylia at *class* rank with an empty order,
so a tortoise comes back as `class=Testudines`. The same happens for
amphibian orders on some keys. The legacy CSVs copied that faithfully; it
was never an AddaxAI bug. AddaxAI shows a Linnaean tree, so these fold
back under their real class, reproducing what SAH-DRY-ADS-v1 ships:

    leopard tortoise,reptilia,testudines,testudinidae,stigmochelys,pardalis

The table mirrors the one in cls-training-pipeline/taxon-mapping, which
is the producer side of this same problem. Keep the two in step.

**Per-row overrides.** Supply any of the five rank columns in the input
CSV and that row is written from those columns alone: GBIF is not
consulted, and the columns left blank stay blank. One rule, so the input
CSV always shows exactly what the row will become.

Use it wherever GBIF lags a published reclassification (the 2021 split
moved the American mink to *Neogale*, which GBIF still resolves as a
genus-rank synonym of *Mustela* with no species at all) and for mixed
groups that have no single taxon (`snake sp` is `reptilia,squamata` and
nothing below, since GBIF files the suborder Serpentes under *family*).

A record's own rank is trusted over its rank fields
---------------------------------------------------
At rank R, the value for column R is taken from canonicalName rather than
from GBIF's `class`/`order`/... fields, because the two disagree. Key
12170551 ("Reptilia", the key this project uses for unknown reptiles)
comes back as rank=CLASS, canonicalName=Reptilia, and class=Squamata.
Trusting the field would claim every unidentified reptile is a squamate
rather than possibly a turtle.

Review the output
-----------------
Rows that could not be resolved, matched only fuzzily, or matched at a
coarser rank than requested are printed to stderr. Non-label classes
(bait, blank, empty, ...) are expected to be empty and are not reported.
GBIF also silently resolves synonyms, which changes the genus:
"Cephalophus monticola" comes back as "Philantomba monticola". Read the
summary before uploading anything.
