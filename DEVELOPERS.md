# Developer Documentation

## Runbooks (skills)

Recurring, gotcha-heavy jobs (adding a classifier to the zoo, building its
taxonomy.csv, running the `test_models.py` harness, publishing a release) are
Claude Code skills under `.claude/skills/` on Peter's machine. That folder is
gitignored, so a clone does not carry them. The sections below are the
reference material those skills point at, and they are the source of truth for
anyone working without them.

## After cloning

Activate the commit-msg hook that strips auto-generated co-author lines:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

This only needs to be run once per clone.

## Logging & Debugging

**Log files:** All logs (backend + frontend) are written to `~/AddaxAI/logs/backend.log`

**Watch logs in real-time:**
```bash
tail -f ~/AddaxAI/logs/backend.log
```

**Add logging in code:**
```python
# Backend (Python)
from app.core.logging_config import get_logger
logger = get_logger(__name__)
logger.info("Operation completed")
logger.error("Something failed", exc_info=True)  # Include stack trace
```

```typescript
// Frontend (TypeScript)
import { logger } from "@/lib/logger";
logger.info("User clicked button", { buttonId: "create-project" });
logger.error("API call failed", { endpoint: "/api/projects", error: err.message });
```

**Log retention:** Automatic rotation at 33MB per file, keeps 3 backups (100MB total, ~7 days). The root logger sits at DEBUG for the beta, and that week only holds if the chatty third-party loggers stay pinned in `setup_logging`: SQLAlchemy at WARNING (one line per query stalled the server) and Pillow at INFO (one line per EXIF tag per image was 87% of a tester's log and rolled the file over in a day). Pin a new firehose there rather than lowering the root.

## Database migrations

Schema changes ship as Alembic migrations under `backend/alembic/versions/`. The app runs `alembic upgrade head` automatically on every startup (`init_db()` in `backend/app/db/base.py`), so users never run migrations by hand.

**Adding a migration:**

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
PYTHONPATH=. alembic revision --autogenerate -m "short description"
```

Review the generated file before committing. Autogenerate is helpful but imperfect: it misses index renames, check constraints, and server-default changes. Edit the upgrade/downgrade bodies if needed.

**Shipped migrations are immutable.** Once a migration has shipped, never edit it or change the schema it created. Make a new migration instead. This is the one rule Alembic depends on: `upgrade head` is only reliable when every DB started at a known revision and ran the official chain forward, in order. Editing a shipped migration (or editing a model without a matching migration) makes the live schema disagree with what the recorded revision claims, and that drift is what caused the repeated startup crashes on beta-tester DBs. `test_upgrade_from_base_matches_models` in `tests/db/test_migrations.py` is the CI guard: it runs the whole chain from base and asserts `schema_problems()` is empty, so a migration that drifts from the models fails the build.

**A migration that touches rows needs a test in `tests/db/test_migration_data.py`.** The CI guard above runs the chain against an *empty* database, so every `UPDATE` and `DELETE` in it matches zero rows and its correctness is never exercised. That is the one remaining way to lose data silently: a wrong data migration leaves the schema matching the models perfectly, so the startup check waves it through, and the only symptom is a user whose verification work is quietly wrong. The recipe is four steps and there are six worked examples in that file:

```python
def test_<revision>_<what it should do>(engine):
    upgrade_to("<the revision before yours>")   # the input schema
    ...insert_row(conn, ...)...                 # the data shape it handles
    upgrade_to("<your revision>")               # one step
    ...assert what the rows became...
```

Use raw SQL via `insert_row` from `tests/db/conftest.py`, never the ORM factories in `tests/conftest.py`: those describe the schema at head, and these tests write into the schema as it was. `insert_row` fills in every required column you do not name, so a test mentions only the columns it cares about.

Nothing detects for you whether your migration needs one of these. That is deliberate: telling "does this touch rows" from the source means a regex over migration text, and a guard that silently false-negatives is worse than none because it converts "I should think about this" into "CI would have caught it".

**Prove the test can fail.** Break the migration on purpose and watch the test go red before you commit it. A data test that passes against a broken migration is the same trap as the idempotency test described below.

**`alembic_version` is ground truth.** The app does not try to work out what revision a schema is "really" at. It runs `alembic upgrade head` and then checks the result against `Base.metadata`. An earlier design did guess, by introspecting marker columns listed in a hand-maintained fingerprint table, and when the guess disagreed with the stamp it re-stamped the DB backwards and replayed the chain. Guessing cannot work in general (drops, renames and data backfills leave no trace), it needed a new bookkeeping row per migration forever, and the replay re-ran one-time data migrations over data that had already moved on. That destroyed user verification work on 2026-05-27. **Never reintroduce automatic replay.** A DB we cannot trust gets handed back to its owner with an error they can act on, not silently rewritten.

**Four rules in `init_db()`:**

1. Empty DB: `alembic upgrade head` builds the whole schema from base.
2. User tables but no `alembic_version` row: refused. Alembic has run on every launch since 2026-05-08 (`78dc9d9c`, which replaced `Base.metadata.create_all` plus a hand-rolled column patcher), so such a DB is from an early beta. This is also what catches the issue #11 shape (Arky's Linux install), which used to be stamped at the initial revision and then died mid-chain with `KeyError: 'captured_at_local'`.
3. A stamped revision that is not on disk, or more than one version row: refused. Alembic raises `CommandError` while resolving the chain, before running anything, and `ensure_upgradable` rejects an ambiguous version table up front rather than letting `get_current_revision` read whichever row SQLite returned first.
4. After upgrading, `schema_problems()` must be empty. Anything missing means the stamp lied, so we stop.

Every refusal raises `SchemaError`, whose message is written for the end user. The lifespan writes it to `~/AddaxAI/.startup-error.txt` and the Electron error page shows it verbatim with **Restore from backup** and **Delete database and start fresh** buttons, because the backend exits before the API or the frontend exist and the in-app dialogs are unreachable at that moment. Those buttons write the same `.restore-on-next-launch` / `.wipe-db-on-next-launch` markers the in-app flows use, so there is one recovery mechanism, not two. Electron deletes the error file just before every spawn, so a message there always belongs to the current launch.

**A slow migration is not a failure.** `waitForBackend` waits on a live backend indefinitely; the only failure is the process dying. After `BACKEND_SLOW_NOTICE_MS` (60s, `ADDAXAI_SLOW_NOTICE_MS` to override) the splash is replaced by a "Still working" page with Open logs and Quit, and **no Retry**. That omission is the point. A backend part-way through a migration has not finished its lifespan, so it does not answer `/health` and looks identical to a wedged one. The old three-minute deadline sent the user to the error page, and its Retry re-entered `ensureBackend`, which probed `/health`, saw nothing, concluded the port was free, and spawned a *second* backend running `alembic upgrade head` against the same SQLite file, orphaning the first. The bigger the database, the likelier that was. The trade made here is that a genuinely wedged backend now waits forever rather than erroring, which is the right side to be wrong on when the two cannot be told apart and Quit is one click away.

**The chain is not replay-safe, and does not need to be.** The forward path runs each migration exactly once against the input it expects. A DB whose stamp is legitimately behind (a restored older backup) replays forward, which is that same once-each path, not a re-run. Nothing replays a migration over its own output: stamp an at-head DB back to base and upgrade and it dies immediately on `table audit_log already exists`. Making that work would mean guarding all 24 shipped migrations including the initial `CREATE TABLE`s, for no benefit. **Do not write a test asserting the chain is idempotent.** There was one; it re-ran zero migrations, because alembic no-ops at head, so it was green and asserted nothing.

**Guard DDL anyway in new migrations.** It costs nothing at authoring time and it pays off on a drifted DB, where it turns a mid-chain crash into the clean `SchemaError` refusal with the recovery buttons. `d4e5f6a7b8c9` is the worked example. Bare `op.batch_alter_table(...).alter_column(...)` throws `KeyError` on SQLite when the reflected table lacks the column. The older migrations do not all do this and are not being retrofitted.

**What `schema_problems()` compares.** Alembic's own `compare_metadata`, filtered to the additive operations, plus a hand-rolled walk over foreign key `ON DELETE` actions. One rule: anything the models declare that the DB lacks. That covers missing tables, columns, indexes and named unique constraints. It deliberately ignores the `remove_*` ops (a half-applied `DROP COLUMN` is harmless) and the `modify_*` ops (nullability, column types, server defaults), where SQLite's loose typing makes a false alarm likelier than the skipped migration it would catch, and a false alarm here refuses a healthy user's launch. The foreign key walk exists because `compare_metadata` reports no FK diffs at all, and a lost `ON DELETE CASCADE` is the one way this design can orphan or lose rows (see "Deleting analysis data").

**Migrations run with foreign keys off.** `alembic/env.py` sets `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF` on the migration connection, as alembic's SQLite batch mode requires. `set_sqlite_pragma` in `db/base.py` turns them on for every engine, alembic's included, and batch mode rebuilds a table with CREATE, copy, `DROP TABLE`, RENAME. With foreign keys on, `DROP TABLE` runs an implicit `DELETE FROM` first and every `ON DELETE CASCADE` fires: rebuilding `projects` emptied sites, deployments, files and detections in the test that found this (2026-08-27). Two consequences. A batch rebuild of a parent table is safe now and was not before, so treat any pre-June-2026 database with care. And a `DELETE` inside a migration no longer cascades: a data migration that removes parent rows must delete the children itself. `f2a3b4c5d6e7` shipped relying on the cascade and leaves orphan `detection_embeddings` behind on such old databases; harmless (every join ignores them), recorded in `_ORPHANS_KNOWN` in the test below, and not worth a cleanup migration until someone actually upgrades from that far back.

**Every migration is run on a database with a row in every table.** `tests/db/test_migration_keeps_rows.py` stands the database up at the revision before each migration, seeds one row per table with the foreign keys wired, runs that one step and asserts no table lost a row and SQLite's `integrity_check` and `foreign_key_check` are clean. It needs no backups, so it runs in CI. A migration that deletes rows on purpose gets an entry in `_DELETES_ON_PURPOSE` there, together with its test in `test_migration_data.py`. `backend/scripts/check_migration_on_backups.py` does the same on copies of every backup in `~/AddaxAI/backups/`, real rows included; run it before releasing a migration on a machine that has backups. Both share `app/db/migration_check.py`.

**SQLite 3.45 reports a false NULL after `ADD COLUMN <x> REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT`.** The rows are not rewritten by the add, the default is filled in on read, and every version reads the value back fine; but `integrity_check` in 3.45.x (the CI runner, and the frozen macOS and Windows builds) says `NULL value in <table>.<x>` until each row is rewritten by an UPDATE. Integer, text and boolean defaults are not affected, and 3.46 fixed it. `c5d6e7f8a9b0` is the one shipped case; it is harmless because `e7f8a9b0c1d2` drops a column right after, which rewrites every projects row, and every release ships both. The test lists it in `_INTEGRITY_FALSE_POSITIVE`. The trap that stays open: a future float column with no row rewrite behind it would make `validate_backup` refuse to restore a backup on the shipped build. Add such a column as nullable, or follow it with an `UPDATE`.

**Helpers** (in `backend/app/db/migrations.py`): `SchemaError`, `ensure_upgradable(engine)`, `schema_problems(engine)`, `get_current_revision(engine)`, `get_head_revision()`, `needs_upgrade(engine)`, `upgrade_to_head()`. All alembic imports are local to the function bodies so the module is cheap to import.

**Dropping a column on SQLite: use raw DDL, not batch mode.** Alembic's `op.batch_alter_table(...) as batch: batch.drop_column(...)` is the textbook pattern but it builds its starting-point table from `target_metadata` (the SQLAlchemy models). When you remove the column from the model in the same commit as the migration (the natural workflow), the metadata no longer has the column and the batch flush dies with `KeyError`. `copy_from=sa.Table(name, sa.MetaData(), autoload_with=op.get_bind())` is the documented escape hatch but does not reliably pick up the column on every live DB. Since SQLite 3.35+ (Python 3.13 ships with 3.51) supports native `ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN`, just write the DDL directly.

**Always guard column drops with a presence check.** A blind `DROP COLUMN` on a DB that is stamped past the add-column migration but never actually got the column will crash startup, and a DB whose stamp is behind replays the chain forward as a matter of routine. Skip the DDL when the column isn't there, since the end state matches what the migration was trying to achieve:

```python
import sqlalchemy as sa
from alembic import op

def _projects_columns(bind) -> set[str]:
    return {c["name"] for c in sa.inspect(bind).get_columns("projects")}

def upgrade() -> None:
    bind = op.get_bind()
    if "observations_max_detections" in _projects_columns(bind):
        op.execute(
            "ALTER TABLE projects DROP COLUMN observations_max_detections"
        )

def downgrade() -> None:
    bind = op.get_bind()
    if "observations_max_detections" not in _projects_columns(bind):
        op.execute(
            "ALTER TABLE projects "
            "ADD COLUMN observations_max_detections INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 20000"
        )
```

One line of DDL, no reflection gymnastics, no batch-mode failure mode, idempotent against drifted DBs. Add-column never needed batch (`op.add_column` works directly). Batch mode is still the right call for type changes and nullability tweaks, which do not have a native single-statement DDL on SQLite.

## Deleting analysis data

Deleting a project, deleting a folder run, re-running a folder run and deleting a deployment all end in the same place: `purge_deployment_data()` followed by one `db.delete(<parent>)`, which together have to remove every file, detection, embedding, event and observation underneath it. On a large run that is millions of rows, so how it is done matters.

**The database owns the cascade, not the ORM.** Every parent/child foreign key declares `ON DELETE CASCADE`, `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` is set on every connection (`db/base.py`), and every `cascade="all, delete-orphan"` relationship sets `passive_deletes=True`. SQLAlchemy therefore emits one `DELETE` for the parent and lets SQLite do the rest in C.

**The rule, with no exceptions:**

> every relationship with `delete-orphan` whose child foreign key declares `ON DELETE CASCADE` sets `passive_deletes=True`

`tests/models/test_cascade_config.py` enforces it. Use `True`, never `"all"` (that one is rejected in combination with `delete-orphan`).

Without it, SQLAlchemy loads every child row into memory as a Python object before deleting it, one lazy SELECT at a time. Deleting a 50,000-file run emitted 277,014 statements and peaked at 1.5 GB of RAM.

**Index the child column of every foreign key.** When a parent row is deleted, SQLite has to find the rows referencing it. With no index on the child column that is a full table scan **per deleted parent row**. `event_observations.max_n_file_id` (`ON DELETE SET NULL` to `files`) was unindexed, so deleting a 50,000-file run scanned the whole observations table 50,000 times: 8 minutes on a fast Mac, hours on a beta tester's laptop. The same shape applies to `NO ACTION` foreign keys, where SQLite still has to prove no child references the row.

These indexes exist for constraint enforcement, not for queries, so they look unused when you grep for them. Do not remove them. `test_upgrade_from_base_matches_models` in `tests/db/test_migrations.py` is the guard: it runs the chain from base and asserts `schema_problems()` is empty, which covers missing tables, columns, indexes, named unique constraints and foreign key `ON DELETE` actions in one assertion.

**That guard is one-directional, on purpose.** `schema_problems()` reports only what the models declare and the database lacks (`_ADDITIVE_OPS`). So it catches "added an index to the model, forgot the migration", which is the mistake people actually make, and it stays quiet about an index the migrations create that no model declares. Verified by removing each half in turn: the forgotten migration fails with `missing index <name> on <table>`, the extra live index passes. If you need a query index gone, remove it from both sides or it silently survives.

Also index the columns a hot query filters on, not only foreign keys. `files.file_path` was unindexed while ingest looked every file up by `(file_path, deployment_id)` before inserting it, so the planner fell back to `idx_files_deployment`, which has no selectivity when a whole library sits in one deployment. File N scanned N rows and a 1M-image ingest spent ~11 hours on lookups alone. `idx_files_deployment_path` (migration `7a8b9c0d1e2f`) makes it a single seek.

**Consequences to know about:**

- After a passive delete, child objects already in the session are stale until the session is expired. Every call site commits immediately (`expire_on_commit` is on), so app code never sees this, but a test that does `db.delete(parent); db.flush()` and then `db.get(Child, id)` will get the cached object back. Query the database instead.
- Already-loaded collections still cascade in Python. `passive_deletes` suppresses *loading*, never cascading of what is loaded.
- A missing `ON DELETE CASCADE` fails loudly with `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed`, not silently with orphan rows, because the child foreign keys are `NOT NULL`.

**Timing.** `POST /api/folder-runs/{id}/rerun` and `_delete_deployment_artifacts` both log elapsed seconds. The on-disk `.addaxai` cleanup stays inside the request and is unbounded on a slow external drive, so when a delete is reported as slow, those two lines are what tell you whether it was the database or the disk.

### Empty the leaves first

`purge_deployment_data()` in `crud/deployment.py` deletes the child tables in bulk, bottom up, before anything deletes the parent. It runs **ahead of** the cascade, never instead of it: every foreign key still declares `ON DELETE CASCADE` and still enforces it, so a child table missing from its list is removed anyway when its parent goes. Forgetting to add one costs a slower delete, never a wrong one.

The reason is the same one that makes the missing-index case above so expensive. SQLite runs a foreign key action program for every row it deletes, at every level. Emptying `detection_embeddings` first means the 800,000 `detections` deletes that follow find nothing to cascade to, and so on up the chain. Measured on a project of 400,000 files, 800,000 detections and 400,000 embeddings, against the SQLite the packaged build carries:

| | |
|---|---|
| 124 s | one `DELETE FROM projects`, cascade does everything (two runs: 124 s, 119 s) |
| 39 s | leaves first, then the parent |
| 41 s | end to end through `DELETE /api/projects/{id}`, including the on-disk cleanup |

Same end state, checked table by table against a plain cascade of the same data, with `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` clean.

Three things this must keep doing, all pinned in `tests/api/test_delete_cascade.py`:

- **Bulk statements, never per-row ORM deletes.** That is what the 1.5 GB incident above was.
- **A SELECT of ids, not a list of ids.** `purge_deployment_data` takes `select(Deployment.id).where(...)` so the whole teardown stays in the database and nothing lands in the session.
- **The order.** Reverse it and every parent delete pays the foreign key action for children that are still there, which is the slow case this exists to avoid. Nothing else would catch a reordering, because the end state is identical either way, so `test_purge_empties_the_leaves_before_their_parents` asserts it directly.

**The endpoint reads `Deployment.folder_path`, not `Deployment`.** It needs the paths for the on-disk cleanup, and loading the entities instead would put every deployment in the session, at which point `db.delete(project)` cascades to them in Python, one `DELETE` each, which is the thing `passive_deletes=True` exists to prevent.

**The on-disk cleanup is best-effort, in every path.** By the time it runs the rows are committed, so an OS error there cannot be reported as a failed delete without lying. Every caller goes through `_delete_deployment_artifacts`, which logs and swallows. The project endpoint used to have its own inline `shutil.rmtree` instead, and a `.addaxai` folder on a disconnected external drive answered `500 Internal Server Error` for a project that was already gone, then skipped the cleanup for every remaining deployment. Camera trap folders live on external drives, so that is the ordinary case. Pinned by `test_a_folder_that_cannot_be_cleaned_does_not_fail_the_delete`.

**A percentage is not available, and that is a design consequence.** The teardown is one transaction and nothing is visible outside it until it commits, so no polling can watch it progress. The per-stage row counts `purge_deployment_data` returns are the only real numbers there are; they go to the log today. If a progress display is ever wanted, those are what it would have to show, over a websocket from inside the transaction. The dialog instead shows the scale up front and a running clock, which answers "is it stuck" without inventing a number.

### Never run a bare `ANALYZE`

Call `refresh_query_statistics()` from `db/base.py` instead. It runs `ANALYZE` and then deletes one row from `sqlite_stat1`, the one for `idx_files_source_video`. Without that deletion a project delete does not finish.

`files.source_video_id` is the schema's only self-referencing foreign key: a frame row points at the video it was extracted from, `ON DELETE CASCADE`. So SQLite consults `idx_files_source_video` once for every `files` row it deletes. `ANALYZE` writes a statistic for that index like every other, and because the column is NULL on every file that is not a video frame, the statistic reads `"382293 382293"`: any value matches the whole table. SQLite 3.45 believes it and stops using the index. The per-row cascade lookup becomes `Rewind`, a full scan of all 380,000 index entries, once per deleted row.

That is what the VDBE program shows, on the same database, for `DELETE FROM files WHERE id = ?`:

```
3.45.1   OpenRead idx_files_source_video ; Rewind   <- full scan
3.50.4   OpenRead idx_files_source_video ; SeekGE   <- one seek
```

Measured on a 294 MB database holding 382,293 files, deleting a project of 369,298 of them:

| | |
|---|---|
| 5.73 ms per file | with 52,230 files in the table |
| ~65 ms per file | with 382,293 files in the table |
| ~6.5 hours | extrapolated for the whole project |
| **4.1 s** | same SQLite, same database, statistic dropped |

Three things have to line up and all three are true in a shipped build, so removing any one of them fixes it. Verified with a 200,000-row synthetic:

| SQLite | self-referencing FK | `ANALYZE` run | delete 400 rows |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.45.1 | yes | yes | **4.07 s** |
| 3.45.1 | yes | no | 0.02 s |
| 3.45.1 | no | yes | 0.01 s |
| 3.50.4 | yes | yes | 0.02 s |

**Dropping the statistic costs nothing, and buys back the index.** Nothing searches by `source_video_id`: `crud/label_tree.py` projects it inside a `count(DISTINCT …)`, and `joinedload(File.source_video)` joins by `files.id`. `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` gives both the same plan with the row and without it. A query that did search by it is helped rather than harmed: with the row present the planner answers `SCAN files`, without it `SEARCH files USING INDEX idx_files_source_video`.

**Why the version alone is not the fix.** The packaged build carries whatever SQLite its frozen Python was built with, `_sqlite3.cpython-311-darwin.so` from Python 3.11.9 is 3.45.1, and that differs per platform and per build. Bumping it is worth doing but it does nothing for anyone already installed, and it is not something a test can hold in place. Dropping the row is correct on every version.

**`PRAGMA optimize` puts the row back, so there is none.** `set_sqlite_pragma` used to run one at connect. It analyses only tables the connection has already queried and ran before that connection's first statement, so it did nothing at all on 3.45 and rewrote this row on 3.50 and later, undoing the deletion on the very next connection. Measured on a 1 GB database: after startup the row was already back, because the first request opened a new connection. That was harmless in practice, since the versions that act on it are the versions without the planner bug, but it made the fix depend on a coincidence rather than on the code, and a future bundle could land on the wrong side of it. It is gone. Do not add one back, anywhere.

`test_a_fresh_connection_does_not_put_the_statistic_back` is the guard, and it builds its own engine on purpose: the pooled engine the other tests share never re-fires the `connect` event, so it cannot see this.

`tests/db/test_query_statistics.py` holds this. It asserts the row is absent and the others are present, plus a grep guard that fails when a new `ANALYZE` appears in `app/` outside the helper. It deliberately does **not** assert the query plan: the development and CI SQLite is 3.53, which uses the index either way, so a plan assertion would be green while the shipped app was broken.

## Database backups

The DB at `~/AddaxAI/addaxai.db` holds irreversible work (human verifications). It is the only piece of user state that cannot be rebuilt by re-running analysis, so it gets a backup story. Backups live under `~/AddaxAI/backups/` and use SQLite's online backup API (`sqlite3.Connection.backup`) so they are WAL-safe and produce a single consolidated `.db` file with no `-wal` / `-shm` siblings.

Four kinds of snapshot:

| Kind | When | Filename pattern | Retention |
|---|---|---|---|
| Daily rolling | App startup, throttled to one per UTC date | `addaxai-<utc-iso>.db` | Keep 5 newest |
| Pre-upgrade | Startup, only when alembic detects a pending upgrade | `addaxai-pre-upgrade-<rev>-<utc-iso>.db` | Keep 5 newest, one per revision |
| Pre-restore | Right before a restore swaps a backup in | `addaxai-pre-restore-<utc-iso>.db` | Keep 5 newest |
| Manual | User clicks "Back up database", or the app is about to wipe the DB | `addaxai-manual-<utc-iso>[-<note>].db` | Never auto-pruned |
| Manual to chosen folder | User clicks "Back up database" → "Save to chosen folder…" | `addaxai-manual-<utc-iso>[-<note>].db` in user-picked dir | Untouched by the app |

**The optional note lives in the filename.** The backup dialog offers a short note ("before the big run"), slugged to lowercase `[a-z0-9-]` and capped at 40 chars by `_slugify_note` in `backup.py`; the restore picker parses it back out of `_MANUAL_RE` and shows it on the card. No sidecar files and no registry, so the note travels with the file and there is no state to fall out of sync. Consequence: app versions from before the note feature do not match the noted filename and will not list such a backup in their restore picker (it stays restorable via "Restore from a file"). The frontend input mirrors the slug rule (`normalizeNote` in `BackupNowDialog.tsx`) so the field shows exactly what the filename gets.

**One pre-upgrade snapshot per revision.** A second copy of the same unmigrated DB is worth nothing and costs a full DB copy, so `pre_upgrade_backup` returns `None` when it already has one for that revision. Without that, repeated launches at the same revision push the real pre-upgrade snapshot out of the ring buffer with identical duplicates, which is exactly the snapshot that matters on the day a migration eats data. Two real ways that happens: a `uvicorn --reload` storm in dev (one observed run left 805 MB of five identical copies), and a user clicking Retry on the startup error page.

**Deleting the DB takes a manual snapshot first.** The `.wipe-db-on-next-launch` marker used to be reachable only by typing `RESET` in the Settings dialog. The startup error page can now write it behind a native confirm, which is a lighter gate on an irreversible action, so the lifespan snapshots the DB before it unlinks it. Manual snapshots are never auto-pruned and show up in the restore picker, so the wipe stays undoable.

**Restore flow.** The frontend posts `/api/backup/restore` with a source path. The backend validates it and writes `~/AddaxAI/.restore-on-next-launch` containing the absolute path. The renderer then asks Electron to quit; the next launch's lifespan calls `consume_restore_marker(settings)` before `init_db()`, which force-snapshots the current live DB to the ring buffer first, then swaps the source file in. The marker is consumed unconditionally even on failure, so a corrupt request can't loop the user through restore-fail-restore-fail forever; the live DB is left untouched on validation failure. The Electron startup error page writes the same marker directly, since a refused DB means the API never comes up.

**Validation is `PRAGMA integrity_check` plus an `alembic_version` row.** The version row is not pedantry: a DB without one predates 2026-05-08 and `init_db` refuses it, so accepting it here would restore a file that fails on the very next launch, with nothing telling the user that the file they picked was the problem.

**Key files:**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `backend/app/db/backup.py` | Snapshot / validate / ring-buffer logic, restore-marker helpers |
| `backend/app/api/routers/backup.py` | `/api/backup/{dir,list,snapshot,restore}` endpoints |
| `backend/app/main.py` lifespan | Consumes the restore marker, takes daily + pre-upgrade snapshots before `init_db()` |
| `backend/app/core/startup_error.py` | Writes the refusal the Electron error page reads |
| `frontend/src/components/diagnostics/BackupNowDialog.tsx` | Manual backup UI (ring buffer or chosen folder) |
| `frontend/src/components/diagnostics/RestoreBackupDialog.tsx` | Restore UI with type-`RESTORE`-to-confirm gate |
| `frontend/src/components/layout/AppHamburger.tsx` | Back up / Restore / Open backups folder menu items |
| `electron/src/main.ts` (`db:restore`, `db:reset`) | The same two actions when the backend will not start |

Pre-init backups in lifespan are best-effort. If `~/AddaxAI/` is read-only or the disk is full, the failed snapshot is logged at error level and startup continues, so the user can at least open the app to see the diagnostic banner and react.

## Removing the legacy AddaxAI install

AddaxAI 7 installs to different locations than AddaxAI 6, so upgrading leaves two full apps on the machine, the old one holding 10 to 30 GB of conda envs and model weights. The app finds the old install and offers to delete it.

**Where legacy lives** (verified against the legacy repo's own install scripts):

| OS | Install root | Also |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\AddaxAI_files\` | junction `%USERPROFILE%\EcoAssist_files` pointing at the root, plus a manual-install variant at `%ProgramFiles%\AddaxAI_files` |
| macOS | `/Applications/AddaxAI_files/` | desktop symlink `~/Desktop/AddaxAI.app` |
| Linux | `~/.AddaxAI_files/` | `~/Desktop/Linux_open_AddaxAI_shortcut.desktop`, `~/.icons/logo_small_bg.png` |

Legacy writes nothing outside that tree. Its analysis outputs land in the user's own image folders and a destination folder they picked, so no user data is at risk.

**Why this is not in the installers.** macOS ships a dmg and drag-to-Applications runs no code. The Linux deb `postinst` runs as root, so `$HOME` is root's home and `$SUDO_USER` is unset under App Center / PackageKit. Only Windows NSIS could do it, which would mean one platform covered and three implementations. One Python implementation running as the logged-in user covers all three, with the right permissions on each.

**Detection is one rule on every platform:** `<root>/AddaxAI/AddaxAI_GUI.py` exists. Folder name alone would be wrong on Windows, where our own installer creates `AddaxAI_files` just to hold the Timelapse shim.

**The Windows shim exception.** `electron/build/installer.nsh` writes a Timelapse launcher to `%USERPROFILE%\AddaxAI_files\AddaxAI\open.bat`, inside the legacy install root. Timelapse still looks for that path, so the purge deletes everything under `AddaxAI_files` **except** that one file. Do not "simplify" this into deleting the whole root.

**Junctions.** NSIS `RMDir /r` follows a junction and deletes through it. Python's `shutil.rmtree` has not followed junctions since 3.8 but raises on a top-level one, so `legacy_install._remove` detects a junction and calls `os.rmdir()`, which drops the reparse point and leaves its target alone. `os.path.isjunction()` is not usable: the frozen build runs Python 3.11 and that helper landed in 3.12.

**Desktop entries are only touched during removal, never during the scan.** On macOS, reading `~/Desktop` triggers a permission prompt for a non-sandboxed app. The scan runs on every launch, so scanning the Desktop would prompt every user including those who never had legacy installed.

**Failure handling.** There is no pre-flight "is legacy running" check. The purge runs, then `remove()` re-checks the marker and returns any surviving paths, and the UI says to close the old app and retry. One rule that covers a running legacy app, antivirus locks and open file managers, on every platform, with no extra dependency.

**The disk-space dead end.** Setup refuses with a 507 below 7 GB free, and the removal prompt only appears once setup has finished. A user with a 15 GB legacy install and a nearly-full disk could therefore never reach the thing that would free the space. `_legacy_disk_hint()` in `routers/setup.py` appends the legacy path to that error so they can delete it by hand. Keep the hint best-effort: it must never turn a clear 507 into a 500.

**Not covered:** installs moved by hand to a custom path (legacy's docs sanction moving to Program Files; EcoAssist 4.x let users type any path). The Program Files copy is reported so the user can delete it, everything else is out of scope. No disk scan.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `backend/app/services/legacy_install.py` | Path table, detection, purge |
| `backend/app/utils/fs_remove.py` | `safe_rmtree`, shared with the reset flow |
| `backend/app/api/routers/setup.py` | `/api/setup/legacy-install` and `.../remove` |
| `frontend/src/components/diagnostics/RemoveLegacyDialog.tsx` | The dialog |
| `frontend/src/components/layout/MenuCommands.tsx` | Auto-prompt, menu command, dismissal flag |

The junction branch cannot be tested on the Linux and macOS CI runners, so it is verified by hand on Windows.

## Background photos

Two screens sit on a full-bleed photo: the home screen (`home-background.webp`) and the setup screen (`setup-background.webp`), both in `frontend/public/`. Both are heavily blurred, which is what keeps them cheap: there is no fine detail left for the encoder to spend bits on, and because the result is soft, the browser stretching the image across a much wider window is invisible. That is why these land in the tens of KB while the phone photos they came from are several hundred.

Recipe, from a source photo that never enters the repo:

```python
im = ImageOps.exif_transpose(Image.open(src)).convert("RGB")   # phone photos carry rotation
im = crop_to_3_2(im)
im = im.resize((1024, 683), Image.LANCZOS)
im = im.filter(ImageFilter.GaussianBlur(1.92))                 # 3.0 at 1600px wide, scaled
im.save(out, "WEBP", quality=55, method=6)
```

Blur first, then encode; the order is the whole trick. Resolution is the cheapest knob: measured against a 1600px reference, dropping to 1024px costs almost nothing once the image is blurred, and halves the file. Do not skip `exif_transpose`, or a portrait photo silently ships on its side.

The scrim over the photo is a CSS gradient, not baked into the image, so darkening or lightening it later costs no re-encode. Keep it that way.

Both screens put the teal wordmark on a frosted plate (`components/layout/LogoPlate.tsx`), because the wordmark is teal on transparent and disappears straight into a forest without one.

### The macOS installer window

The drag-to-Applications window gets the same treatment, from `electron/build/background.png` plus `background@2x.png`. No configuration points at them: `dmg-builder` looks in the build resources folder for `background.tiff`, then `background.png`, and only falls back to its own grey template if neither is there. Drop the files in and they are used. Two rules decide everything about them.

**The size sets the window.** With no `dmg.window` in `package.json`, electron-builder takes `windowWidth` / `windowHeight` straight off the background image, and the icon coordinates already in `dmg.contents` (`130,220` and `410,220`, which are icon *centres*) are placed for the 540x380 default. So the image is exactly 540x380 and the retina copy exactly 1080x760. Change the size and the icons land wrong. `tiffutil` merges the pair at build time; it lives in `/usr/bin` on stock macOS, so the runner has it.

**The wash is not decoration.** With a background *picture*, Finder stops adapting the filename colour to dark mode and draws `AddaxAI` and `Applications` in black in both modes. There is no light/dark trade-off to solve, only one rule: the photo has to be light where those two labels sit. Raw, this photo puts them at 3:1. The 55% white blend takes them to 7.7:1. Measure before changing the photo; the two labels sit in the bands `x 75..185` and `x 355..465`, `y 258..280`.

```python
im = ImageOps.exif_transpose(Image.open(src)).convert("RGB")
im = ImageOps.fit(im, (540 * s, 380 * s), Image.LANCZOS)          # s = 1, then 2
im = im.filter(ImageFilter.GaussianBlur(3.0 * 540 * s / 1600))    # same scaling as above
im = Image.blend(im, Image.new("RGB", im.size, "white"), 0.55)
# then the arrow, on top of the blur, never under it:
#   line (215,220)->(320,220) width 5, head (340,220),(318,208),(318,232), fill #0f6064 at alpha 170
im.save(out, "PNG", optimize=True)                                # PNG or TIFF only
```

The arrow is drawn in because the default template had one and it is the only thing telling a first-time user what to do. Keep it above the blur or it smears.

## Linting (CI enforcement)

GitHub Actions runs **ruff** on every push and PR (`ruff check app tests`). The build fails if there are any errors, so check locally before pushing:

```bash
cd backend
ruff check app tests          # check only
ruff check app tests --fix    # auto-fix import sorting (I001) and unused imports (F401)
```

**Common pitfalls that CI catches:**

| Rule | What it means | How to fix |
|------|---------------|------------|
| **E501** | Line exceeds 100 characters | Break the line: wrap args, use intermediate variables, etc. |
| **I001** | Imports not sorted | Run `ruff check --fix` (auto-fixable) |
| **F401** | Unused import | Remove it, or run `ruff check --fix` |
| **F841** | Variable assigned but never used | Remove the assignment |
| **B904** | `raise` inside `except` without `from` | Use `raise ... from err` or `raise ... from None` |

The max line length is **100 characters** (configured in `pyproject.toml`). This is the #1 source of CI failures, so keep lines short.

## Testing

Backend tests use **pytest** with an in-memory SQLite database. Each test gets a fresh DB session that rolls back after the test, so tests are fully isolated.

```bash
cd backend
pytest                        # run all tests
pytest tests/api/             # run only API tests
pytest tests/ml/              # run only ML/taxonomy tests
pytest tests/integration/     # run integration tests
pytest -x                     # stop on first failure
pytest -k "test_label_tree"   # run tests matching a name pattern
```

Coverage is collected automatically (`--cov=app` in `pyproject.toml`).

**Test structure:**

| Directory | What it tests |
|-----------|---------------|
| `tests/api/` | API endpoints via FastAPI `TestClient` |
| `tests/ml/` | ML utilities (taxonomy parsing, rollup, postprocessing) |
| `tests/integration/` | Multi-step pipelines (event generation, detection pipeline) |
| `tests/models/` | SQLAlchemy model constraints and relationships |
| `tests/` (root) | Standalone unit tests (scoring, websocket, etc.) |

**Writing tests:** Use the factory helpers in `tests/conftest.py` (`make_project`, `make_site`, `make_deployment`, `make_file`, `make_detection`, `make_event_with_files`) to build test data. Use the `client` fixture for API tests and the `db` fixture for direct DB tests.

### The test session reads the way the app reads

`tests/conftest.py` builds its session with `autoflush=False`, matching `get_session_factory()` in `db/base.py`. That is not a style choice: it is the one setting that decides whether the suite can see a whole class of bug.

SQLAlchemy's default is `autoflush=True`, where every query writes the session's pending changes before running. Code that sets an attribute and then asks the database about it therefore reads the new value in a test and the old row in the app. Anything shaped "set it, then query it" is correct in the suite and stale in production, and nothing points at the difference.

That is how the `File.verified` rollup shipped broken. `recompute_file_verified` counts a file's unverified detections in SQL, and its callers set `det.verified = True` in Python first. Relabelling a detection left the file unverified, so `addaxai-files.csv` exported `is_verified = FALSE` for files the user had judged; relabelling the same detection a second time corrected it, because by then the first write had landed. The fix is one `db.flush()` at the top of `recompute_file_verified`, put there rather than at each call site so no caller can forget.

Aligning conftest surfaced three further failures of the same family (`test_events.py`, `test_export.py`). All three were test setup rather than app code, and all three are fixed by flushing at the point the test stops being able to lean on autoflush. Resist the other repair: adding a defensive flush inside the production function makes the tests pass and hides that they were building state the app never builds.

`test_the_test_session_keeps_the_apps_flush_semantics` asserts both halves, so the app turning autoflush on and the test session drifting back to the default each go red. A suite that reads differently from the app is not testing the app.

**The matching rule on the write side: `get_db` never commits.** It yields a session and closes it, so whatever a route leaves pending when it returns is discarded, silently. A helper that deliberately does not commit needs a caller that does, and that commit must not be conditional. `_recalculate_max_n` in `routers/detections.py` returned early when the detection's file belonged to no event, which threw away the `recompute_file_verified` write sitting behind it: drawing a box saved the box and lost the rollup. A file has no event only where event generation never reached it, e.g. an analysis run that failed part way, which is why it went unnoticed.

`test_drawing_a_box_marks_the_file_verified_past_the_request` pins it, and the shape of that test is the point: it calls `db.rollback()` after the request, which discards exactly what `close()` discards and keeps everything already committed. Without that line the assertion reads the still-open transaction and passes whether or not the commit happened. A test that asserts a write survived has to cross the request boundary somehow, or it is asserting nothing.

### Electron end-to-end tests

`electron/tests/` holds Playwright tests that launch the real app, which spawns the real backend against a real database.

```bash
cd electron
nvm use 20
npm run test:e2e
```

They exist for the startup error page, which has no unit-testable seam: the backend refuses a database and exits *before* the API or the frontend exist, so the whole recovery path lives in the main process (a file the backend writes, a page rendered from it, two IPC handlers writing marker files the backend consumes next launch). Only running the app proves those line up.

Two settings exist so they can run in isolation, and both are worth knowing about outside tests too:

- `ADDAXAI_USER_DATA_DIR` is honoured by the Electron side as well as the backend, so the whole app can point at a throwaway directory. Every path in `main.ts` derives from it. It has to: the two processes talk to each other through files in there, so a value they disagree on means markers land where nothing reads them. On the backend, `database_url` and `models_dir` derive from it too (a `model_validator` in `config.py`); explicit `ADDAXAI_DATABASE_URL` / `ADDAXAI_MODELS_DIR` still win, and `tests/test_config.py` pins the derivation plus a guard that bans `Path.home()` outside `config.py` and `legacy_install.py`. This is also the supported way to run on machines where group policy blocks executables in user profiles: install the app to an allowed folder and set `ADDAXAI_USER_DATA_DIR` machine-wide (user docs: `docs/docs/help/locked-down-computers.mdx`). Every backend env var carries the `ADDAXAI_` prefix (`env_prefix` in `config.py`), because generic names like `DATABASE_URL` collide with other tooling; the one deliberate exception is that the HuggingFace mirror settings also honour the ecosystem names `HF_ENDPOINT` / `HF_HUB_DISABLE_XET` as fallbacks (`app/__init__.py` propagates the prefixed names to them for huggingface_hub itself).
- `ADDAXAI_BACKEND_PORT` moves the backend off 8000. The app kills any AddaxAI backend already holding its port, so without this a test run would kill your dev server.

Native dialogs cannot be driven from Playwright, so `dialog.showOpenDialog` / `showMessageBox` are stubbed via `electronApp.evaluate()`, along with `app.relaunch` (which would otherwise leave a second app running). What is under test is the wiring from button to marker file, not Electron's own APIs.

Note that `npm run build` only typechecks `src/`; Playwright transpiles the specs without typechecking them.

## Detection threshold and verified override

Three confidence values exist and must not be confused:

1. **MD output**: MegaDetector always runs at `MD_OUTPUT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.01`, passed as `--threshold` (images) and `--json_confidence_threshold` (videos). Everything at or above it is stored: raw results.json, the database, and `addaxai-recognitions.json`, which is the one export that still carries every stored box on every frame.

   **That 0.01 is our cap, not MegaDetector's.** MD's own floor is 0.005 and its docs advise never going below that. We cap higher because 0.005 stored a tail nothing in the app could address: every confidence slider bottoms out at 0.01 (`CONFIDENCE_SCALE_MIN`), the classification gate at 0.1, counting at 0.2, best-frame scoring at 0.3. Measured on a real 24,337-detection database before the change, **19% of all detection rows sat between 0.005 and 0.01**, none ever verified, classified, counted or visible. They cost disk, delete time and query time and bought nothing. Raising it changes no behaviour, because every consumer already sits far above 0.01.

   It applies to new analyses only. Rows already stored below 0.01 stay put, harmless and unreachable, until a re-analysis replaces them; there is deliberately no migration deleting them (a data migration touching rows needs its own test, and a re-analysis clears them for free). Consequence to know: `addaxai-recognitions.json` from a new run carries fewer near-noise boxes than one from an old run of the same folder, which is what Timelapse reads.

All confidence defaults live in `backend/app/core/confidence.py`, mirrored by `frontend/src/lib/confidence.ts`. Change them there, never as literals at call sites.
2. **`Project.classification_gate`** (default 0.1): detection confidence above which animal crops are classified and embedded. Inference-time; changing it applies to new analyses. Gating both per-crop model passes is what keeps the untresholded MD output from multiplying compute.
3. **`Project.counting_threshold`** (default 0.2): the counting/visualization filter described below. A folder run gets the same default and the same meaning; it is not pinned to the classification gate (that pinning was removed, see the comment in `routers/folder_runs.py`).

**One scope for every table, in both modes.** `get_scoped_detection_rows` always applies the threshold plus the verified override, and `build_detection_rows` additionally drops boxes off a video's visible frame. So `addaxai-detections.csv`, the XLSX detections sheet, `addaxai-files.csv`, `addaxai-summary.csv` and `counts.csv` all describe the same population, and that population is what the Labels grid shows. The summary is built from the same scoped rows as the detections table, so its `n_detections` is that table's row count per species by construction. There used to be an `apply_threshold=False` escape hatch that the two folder-run table writers passed; it produced a workbook whose own sheets disagreed, and users read the surplus rows as species the app was hiding from them. Deleted. The complete record is `addaxai-recognitions.json`.

Detections below `counting_threshold` are hidden from the UI. However, verified detections always pass, regardless of confidence. A human verification is a stronger signal than a model score.

**The rule:** anywhere you query detections and the result is user-facing, apply:

```python
threshold_or_verified(threshold)  # ml/label_exclusion.py
```

It expands to "confidence at or above the threshold, OR verified as
something real": the verified override, minus rejected boxes that never
passed the threshold on their own. That refinement is what keeps the
weak boxes a file sign-off rejects (see "Verifying a file rejects its
invisible detections") buried, so do not inline the plain
`or_(confidence >= threshold, verified)` — every backend module that
counts, lists, filters, displays or exports detections calls the helper
(`statistics`, `label_tree`, `event`, `event_observation`, `export`,
`performance`, `file`, the routers, the media output writers,
`embedding_utils`). The similarity sort worker keeps a hand-written SQL
copy (no `app.*` on its path); it is marked at both ends.

**When adding a new query that touches detections**, check whether the result is user-facing. If yes, call the helper. If you skip this, detection counts and filter options will be inconsistent with what the user sees in the verification grid.

**Three exceptions where the helper does not apply:**
1. **User-driven confidence range filters** (e.g. a max_confidence ceiling). When a user explicitly sets a confidence range, respect it literally. The override only applies to the project's threshold floor, not to user-specified ceilings. The classification confidence range is different again: it is a filter on the classifier's score, so it applies to classified boxes only and an unclassified box passes it at both ends (`classification_score_in_range` in `ml/label_exclusion.py`, with the sort worker's SQL copy). A bare `label_confidence >= min` hid every unclassified box the moment the slider left its floor, and those are exactly the boxes a person needs to find to label by hand.
2. **Per-file detection lists** (`crud/detection.py`). These serve the file detail view where the caller controls what to show. Not tied to the project threshold.
3. **The anonymise blur** (`annotated_copies.py`) keeps the plain threshold-or-verified clause on purpose: privacy costs are asymmetric, so a person box a reviewer waved off is still blurred.

**Common mistake:** writing `Detection.confidence >= threshold` without the override. This silently drops verified low-confidence detections from counts, filters, and charts. The result is that users see different numbers on different pages.

**The same rule applies to what is drawn, not only to what is counted.** `shouldDrawBbox` in `frontend/src/lib/detection-utils.ts` is the one place a bounding box is admitted to a canvas, and it carries the override too. Relabelling never rewrites `Detection.confidence` (`bulk_relabel` and `update_detection` both leave it alone), so a box a human confirmed at 3% keeps that 3% forever. Without the override such a box earns a card, a count and a MaxN, and then paints no rectangle on the photo those numbers describe.

It also refuses a box a person **rejected**, mirroring `is_a_real_detection()`. A falsed box is already out of every count, so outlining it argues with the number printed beside it. The row itself is kept (see "Non-label detection skip"), it is just not drawn on any counting surface.

**Both rules live in `passesDrawFilter`, not in `shouldDrawBbox` itself.** `VideoPlayer` draws every frame's boxes over the real video on purpose, so it cannot use `shouldDrawBbox` (the best-frame gate would blank it), and it used to carry its own inline `confidence < threshold` instead. Neither rule reached it, and the result was one event modal disagreeing with itself: in the Counts event view a box a human confirmed below the threshold drew in frame mode and vanished on play, while a box they rejected did the reverse. If a new surface needs the rules without the frame gate, call `passesDrawFilter`; do not inline the comparison again.

**No rule reads who drew a box.** A drawn box is created verified at confidence 1.0, so every rule above treats it like any confirmed box, and a drawn box the person later marked false disappears like any rejected box. If you ever do need provenance (exports, debugging), `job_id is None` is the only exact marker: `create_human_detection` is the sole writer that leaves it unset. Do not substitute `confidence == 1.0` (true today only by construction) or `classification_method == "human"` (set by *relabelling* a machine box as well).

**A frontend type is not evidence that a field is on the wire.** `schemas/file.py` has its own `DetectionResponse`, separate from the one in `schemas/detection.py`, and it carried neither `verified` nor `job_id` while `api/types.ts` declared both. Neither type checker can see that: TypeScript believes its own declaration and Python never reads it. Both fields are now required there rather than defaulted, so a missing one fails loudly instead of arriving as a plausible `undefined` that reads as "not verified" and "not human-drawn". `tests/api/test_file_detection_wire_fields.py` asserts the wire, which is the only place the two sides meet; a frontend unit test would build its fixture from the same lying type and pass.

## Verifying a file rejects its invisible detections

Signing a file off on the Files tab says "the boxes you can see are all
there is". `set_file_verified` (`crud/file.py`) makes that true: on the
file's visible frame, every box the person could not see (below
`counting_threshold` and not verified) is rejected the way the X key
rejects a box (`mark_detections_false` in `crud/detection.py`: label
"false detection", verified, `classification_method = "human"`, same
per-project taxonomy row), and every box they could see is verified. One
rule for empty and non-empty files alike, and for every box whoever drew
it: a drawn box is created verified at confidence 1.0, so it is always
visible and never hit. Unverifying a file clears `verified` on every box
of the file, drawn ones included; the next reprocess then overwrites the
unverified rejects with the machine's own call, so an untick genuinely
hands the file back to the AI. Both paths re-derive `observation_type`
and the event MaxN, as the detection endpoints do. Verify is idempotent,
so a second Enter picks up boxes added since.

**Why reject rather than leave the weak boxes.** Left alone they made
"verified" true only at the threshold it was checked at: drop the
confidence slider and the file came back carrying a 3% smudge while
still flagged verified. They used to be DELETED instead, which had two
costs the rejection does not: the reprocess matcher reported the deleted
boxes as errors on any signed-off-then-unticked file forever (measured:
13 phantom errors for one file), and nothing short of a full re-analysis
could bring them back.

**The scope rule is what makes rejection viable.**
`threshold_or_verified(threshold)` in `ml/label_exclusion.py` is the
user-facing scope predicate: a detection passes on its own confidence,
or because a human verified it *as something real*. A rejected box below
the threshold fails both halves, so it stays invisible at every
threshold, in every list, count, export, media output and performance
metric. Without that refinement the rejected rows are verified and the
plain threshold-or-verified rule surfaces all of them (a real project
measured 4,050 weak boxes against 7,526 passing ones). Every user-facing
query goes through the helper; the two hand copies (the similarity sort
worker's SQL and `passesDrawFilter` on the frontend) are marked at the
definition. One deliberate exception: the anonymise blur keeps the plain
rule, because un-blurring a person on a reviewer's say-so is the wrong
side to be wrong on. An above-threshold box a person pressed X on still
passes, so the grid and the exports keep showing that verdict.

**Scoped to the visible frame.** For a video that is its best frame plus
verified boxes on any frame. Boxes on frames nobody saw are neither
rejected nor verified; before this the verify write had no frame clause
and signed off boxes on frames the person never opened. A video with no
best frame has no visible surface, so verifying it sets the flag and
touches no boxes.

**The reprocess side.** `update_database_from_smoothed_results` matches
JSON detections to rows by `file_path` + bbox + `frame_number` and
counts an unmatched one as an error. Rejected rows still match, so a
signed-off file reprocesses with zero errors, verified rows are skipped
(the verdict holds), and after an untick the machine simply relabels
them. The exemption in `postprocessing.py` (unmatched boxes on verified
files are not errors) stays for two reasons: databases checked before
2026-09-02 hold files whose weak boxes were deleted under the old
design, and a machine box a person moved or resized no longer matches
its JSON key either.

**A rejected box does not make a file look occupied.** The Files tab's
empty filter applies `is_a_real_detection()`, so a file whose only real
box was marked false reads as empty; verifying it rejects the weak boxes
beside the rejected one and leaves the rejected box, which is verified
and therefore never touched.

Tests: `tests/api/test_file_verify_rejects.py` (including the parity pin
that an auto-rejected box is field-for-field identical to a pressed X,
and the scope pin), `tests/api/test_files.py` (the bulk endpoint) and
the reprocess pair in `tests/integration/test_postprocessing_pipeline.py`
(`test_an_unticked_files_rejected_boxes_reprocess_cleanly`,
`test_a_discarded_box_is_not_reported_as_a_reprocess_error`).

## Non-label detection skip

MegaDetector sometimes produces false positive bounding boxes. When a classification model (SpeciesNet or custom) classifies a detection as one of the non-label classes, the detection is not loaded to the database at all. This keeps false positives out of counts, filters, and the verification UI.

**Non-label classes** (defined in `backend/app/ml/label_exclusion.py`): `bait`, `blank`, `empty`, `false detection`, `non-animal` (the MegaDetector false-positive class of MEWC models such as SOCAL-IRC-v3-6), `none`, `vide` (French for empty). These are always stripped, regardless of project settings.

**The rule:** a detection is skipped when its **raw top-1** classification is a non-label class. That is `should_skip_detection`, and it is what the DB load calls (`json_pipeline.py`, gated on `category == "animal"`). Detections with no classifier output (unclassified animals) are still loaded with `label=NULL`. Person and vehicle detections are never classified and are always loaded.

Do not confuse it with `is_non_label_detection` in the same module, which skips only when *every* remaining classification has been filtered out. That one is legacy: nothing in `app/` calls it, only the unit tests do. The distinction matters because the JSON keeps the top 5 classifications per detection, so "all filtered out" is a far rarer condition than "top-1 is blank", and reading the wrong function gives you the wrong mental model of what reaches the database.

User species exclusion is a separate path: `apply_label_exclusion_to_results` in postprocessing, which builds its excluded set from the non-label classes plus the project's `excluded_classes`.

**An excluded class has exactly one owner per run, and it is never the sweep.** With taxonomic rollup on, the filter stays out of the way (`rollup_handles_exclusion=True`) and Path A in `rollup_single_detection` redirects an excluded top-1 to its nearest allowed ancestor, using the model's full classification list. With rollup off, the filter drops the excluded classes from every list before smoothing, so the next best included class becomes the label at its own score, no renormalisation. A list that empties, or whose best remaining class scores below `CONFIDENCE_SCALE_MIN` (1%, a score no slider can show; measured: a 99% cat left "snowshoe hare 0.3%"), leaves the box unclassified. Exclusion names match lowercase on both sides, as the rollup matches them. Until 2026-09-06 the filter deferred whenever a `taxonomy.csv` existed, whether or not rollup was on, so with rollup off nothing handled the excluded top-1: it reached the database and the final sweep in `update_database_from_smoothed_results` erased it. A user who selected one of a sex-age model's 87 classes lost 736 of 799 labels in one run, because the model's confident answer on every sharp photo was an excluded variant. That sweep still exists as a safety net and now logs a warning with its count; in a healthy run it finds nothing. Pinned by the rollup-off and rollup-on pair in `tests/integration/test_postprocessing_pipeline.py`.

**Observation type:** files where all detections were skipped get `observation_type="blank"`. They are counted as blank images on the dashboard, and they are reachable on the Labels page's Files tab with the Empty filter (see "Verifying a file rejects its invisible detections"). They have no card in the Detections tab, which is per-detection.

**Raw JSON preservation:** the JSON on disk (`results.json`) is never modified. It contains all original detections including those classified as blank. The skip only applies during the in-memory DB load step.

**The same rule is applied a second time, at read time.** The ingest skip cannot reach a human who presses X on the Labels page later: "Mark false" writes `label = "false detection"` and deliberately leaves the detector's `category` alone (the category is the detector's and is never translated), while also setting `verified = True`, and a verified box always passes the threshold. So the rejected box became the file's subject. Measured: the file exported `observation_type = animal` with `classification_label = false detection` beside it, and the Counts page grew an observation called "false detection" with a MaxN of 1.

Two places apply it, because they are two different queries:

- `strongest_passing_detection` (`ml/observation_type.py`) skips them, which fixes `observation_type` and therefore `files.csv`, folder placement and annotated copies in one move.
- `_is_a_real_observation` in `crud/event_observation.py` skips them in the MaxN query, which groups by `COALESCE(label, category)` in its own SQL and never goes through the function above.

**The row is kept, not deleted.** A human looked at that box and judged it. Keeping it preserves the undo stack on the Labels page, and keeps `addaxai-detections.csv` an honest record of what the detector found and what was rejected. A file sign-off keeps its rejected weak boxes for the same reason (see the section above); the difference is that those were never examined individually, so `threshold_or_verified` keeps them below the surface while a box someone actually pressed X on stays visible in the grid.

`tests/api/test_mark_false.py` pins it, including that a real animal beside a falsed box still names the file, and that all six non-label classes behave alike.

**Key files:**

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `backend/app/ml/label_exclusion.py` | `NON_LABEL_CLASSES` set, `is_non_label_detection()` helper |
| `backend/app/ml/json_pipeline.py` | Skip logic in `load_json_to_database()` and `_load_to_database()` |

## Scanning a folder for media

Every scan goes through `walk_media_files` in `backend/app/services/folder_scanner.py`: the preview (`scan_folder`), the CSV import's per-row counts (`count_media_files`), and the analysis worker's input enumeration (`detection_worker.scan_folder_for_media`). One walk, one set of rules, so the input the user is shown and the input the detector reads cannot disagree. That drift is what once let a previous run's output folders get reprocessed.

**An unreadable folder must never be reported as an empty one.** `os.walk` defaults to `onerror=None`, which *discards* every error `os.scandir` raises and simply yields nothing for that directory. A folder we cannot list is then indistinguishable from a folder with nothing in it, and every caller says "0 images". `walk_media_files` passes an `onerror` that re-raises, so the failure comes out.

This is not hypothetical. A beta tester's external USB drive answered `0 images, 0 videos` for a path and then `8969 images` for the same path sixteen seconds later, with `[Errno 5] Input/output error` on that drive elsewhere in the same log. The scan spent five seconds failing (a real empty folder answers instantly) and reported the failure as an empty folder, so the user went looking for a problem in their data instead of their hardware.

**The worker is the reason this matters more than it looks.** A preview that under-reports is a confusing screen. A short list in `scan_folder_for_media` means MegaDetector runs over part of a folder, and the deployment is written to the database as complete, with no way to tell afterwards. Never catch the `OSError` there to "keep the run going".

**The cost, accepted deliberately:** one unreadable subdirectory now fails the whole scan instead of being skipped. That is the right side to be wrong on. The alternative is a partial ingest reported as a success, which "crash early and loudly" exists to prevent.

Where the error surfaces:

| Caller | What the user gets |
|---|---|
| `preview-folder`, `deployments/{id}/scan` | 403 with the permission wording for a denied listing, 503 with `FOLDER_UNREADABLE_DETAIL` ("the drive may have disconnected") for anything else |
| CSV import | The row is flagged `FOLDER_UNREADABLE`, never `FOLDER_HAS_NO_MEDIA`. Per row on purpose: one flaky folder must not throw away a CSV the user just filled in |
| Analysis worker | The job fails |

`FolderSelector.tsx` reads `error` off the scan query. Without that it falls through to its "No images found in this folder" branch and blames the user's data for a drive that did not answer, which defeats the whole fix.

Pinned by `backend/tests/services/test_folder_scanner_errors.py`, which makes a subdirectory unreadable with `chmod 000` and skips itself when that is not enforced (running as root), so it can never pass vacuously.

## What a file is about

One rule, everywhere:

> A file is its **single strongest passing detection**. Strongest is verified first, then detector confidence. `File.observation_type` is that detection's raw category; the file's folder is that detection's species if it has one, else its category. Nothing passes, the file is `blank`.

`backend/app/ml/observation_type.py` is the only implementation, and it is two functions: `strongest_passing_detection` picks the box, `derive_observation_type` reads that box's category. Anything needing another attribute of the deciding box calls the first one rather than re-deriving the ordering. The Files export does exactly that, carrying `detection_confidence` / `classification_label` / `classification_confidence` / the five taxon ranks / `scientific_name` / `common_name` off the same box `observation_type` came from. Note the consequence for `detection_confidence`: because the ordering puts verified first, it is the deciding box's score and not the file's highest, so it can sit below the project threshold and filtering a CSV on it drops verified files. Documented in `docs/docs/reference/exports.md` rather than solved with another column. The rule knows no category vocabulary, needs no classifier, and works for any detector.

**For a video, "its detections" means the best frame's.** The module itself is frame-blind: every caller passes it the file's *visible surface* first, via `on_visible_frame()` / `on_visible_frame_of()` in a query or `visible_detections(file, dets)` on a list already in memory. So one sentence covers a video everywhere: AddaxAI saves one frame per video, and every still surface and every summary of that video comes from that frame. (`VideoPlayer` still draws every frame's boxes on the real video, deliberately, which is why the sentence says "still surface" and not "everything".) Consequences worth knowing: a video whose best frame holds nothing passing reads `blank` even when a confident box sits on another frame, and a video with no `best_frame_number` at all has no visible surface, so only a verified box can speak for it. Both are the honest answer, because those boxes have no card in the Labels grid, no MaxN count and no crop. They are still in `detections.csv` and the recognition JSON. Migration `6f7a8b9c0d1e` backfilled existing videos; it is scoped to `file_type = 'video'` so an image, whose `frame_number` and `best_frame_number` are both NULL, can never be touched by the comparison.

**An event uses a different rule, on purpose. Do not unify them.** `build_event_primary_labels` in `postprocessing_outputs/separate_folders.py` picks a burst's species by the *most common* verified species, not by the strongest single box. That is not drift, and "fixing" it in either direction breaks something.

A file is one photograph: one look at the animal, nothing to average, so the strongest box is the whole of the evidence. An event is dozens of looks at the same animal walking through, and per-frame classification is noisy: one raccoon crossing a clip read as northern raccoon, american badger, american badger, blank, virginia opossum, northern raccoon, blank on seven consecutive frames (see "The best frame is the only frame a video detection can be shown on"). Taking the mode across those frames cancels that out. Taking the strongest box would let one lucky misread frame name the whole visit, on the surface the user actually sees, the folder on disk.

The reverse is worse. A file usually has one to three boxes, so a mode over them is close to a coin flip, and it would destroy the guarantee that `observation_type`, the label, the five ranks and the two names all come from one box, because you would have to pick a representative box for the taxonomy anyway.

The two never meet today: the event label is used only by `separate_folders` and its preview, only when `group_events` is on, and reaches no export. **If an event-level label is ever added to an export, revisit this**, because then two rules for "what is this about" sit side by side in one file and the difference has to be explained to users rather than only to maintainers.

**Why not a category priority.** Until 2026-07-31 this ranked categories instead (animal > human > vehicle), so one animal box at 0.21 beat thirty person boxes at 0.95. A test clip of a person in camouflage inspecting a camera produced 31 person boxes at 0.65 to 0.95 and one false-positive animal box that SpeciesNet called "chimpanzee" at 29%. Priority made the file an animal, that lone box was then the only labelled detection so it named the folder, and the run wrote `addaxai-media/chimpanzee/IMG_0001_still.jpg` containing a picture correctly labelled `Person 73%`. Ranking categories cannot be right when the thing being ranked is the detector's own guess about the category.

**The category is the detector's, and is never translated.** `Detection.category` and `File.observation_type` carry whatever the run's own `detection_categories` map said: `animal` / `person` / `vehicle` from MegaDetector, `shark` / `fish` / `turtle` from a detector that emits those. `json_pipeline` reads that map rather than assuming, and **refuses an id the run never declared** instead of defaulting it to `animal`, which is what silently turned every class of a non-MegaDetector model into wildlife.

**The one translation is Camtrap DP.** `observationType` there has a fixed controlled vocabulary (`animal`, `human`, `vehicle`, `blank`, `unknown`, `unclassified`) defined by the standard, not by us. `_obs_type_from_category` in `crud/export.py` is the only place a category is converted: `person` becomes `human`, and anything that is not a person, vehicle or blank becomes `animal`, which is where Camtrap DP puts all wildlife with the species in `scientificName`. Emitting a raw `shark` there would fail validation in the `camtrapdp` R package and in GBIF ingestion.

**Do not add a fifth category map.** There were four, all subtly different, and one Pydantic `Literal` that rejected any other detector's output at the schema boundary before the code that would have handled it ran. They are now one function plus the Camtrap boundary. If you find yourself writing `if category == "animal"`, ask whether you mean "is this the strongest detection" or "is this wildlife", and reuse the existing helper for the first.

`observation_type` is denormalised, so it is recomputed at ingest, after postprocessing, on any detection edit, and on a project threshold change. A rule change therefore needs a data migration; `5e6f7a8b9c0d` is the worked example, with its data test in `tests/db/test_migration_data.py`.

## Paths to user media are never resolved

One rule:

> A user media path is `deployment_folder / <the JSON's relative "file" entry>`, in the form the user picked. Never call `resolve()` on it, and never `relative_to(deployment_folder)` to get the relative part back: the JSON entry already is it.

`Deployment.folder_path` is stored exactly as picked (the folder picker, the CSV import's `normalize_folder`, the worker's `Path(entry.folder_path)` all leave it alone), and `File.file_path` is built from it by `load_json_to_database`. Every place that later compares the two therefore holds by construction: `startswith`, `relative_to`, the postprocessing lookup key, the split-into-children rewrite.

**Why `resolve()` is the enemy here.** On Windows, `Path.resolve()` expands a mapped network drive or a `subst` drive to its UNC target (CPython bpo-37993, since 3.8): `U:\cameras\...` becomes `\\192.168.2.245\Imagery Storage\cameras\...`. The deployment folder is never resolved, so a resolved file path is not under it any more. Measured on a beta tester's Windows machine (2026-08-20): every deployment holding a video failed in classification with `ValueError: '\\192.168.2.245\...\04270001.AVI' is not in the subpath of 'U:\...'`, while photos on the same drive worked. Only video paths reach a `relative_to`, so the user read it as an AVI problem and found a forum thread about an unrelated, already fixed AVI crash. Three sites had that exact shape (`json_pipeline.py` in the classifier path and at DB load, `best_frame.py` in the no-classifier path).

**The crash was the visible half.** Because `File.file_path` was written from the resolved form, on such a machine no file row started with `Deployment.folder_path`, and eight `relative_to` consumers catch the `ValueError` and degrade silently: folder verification (`crud/deployment.py`) skipped every sample and reported the folder valid, relink rewrote the folder pointer and left every file row stale, species folders (`separate_folders.py`) flattened the user's subfolders, and the Files export fell back to bare filenames, which collide across cameras. Removing the `resolve()` fixes all of it at once, which is why this is a rule and not a patch on three lines.

**Sites that resolve both sides are fine and are left alone**: `recognition_json.py` and the preview endpoints in `routers/deployments.py` resolve the file and the folder together, so they can never disagree. App-internal paths (models dir, backups, environments) are not user media and are unaffected.

**On macOS and Linux this changes one thing**: a deployment folder reached through a symlink now stores the symlink form, not the target. That is the same rule and matches what `normalize_folder` already promised.

`tests/ml/test_media_paths_never_resolved.py` and its integration sibling pin it with a symlinked deployment folder, which diverges under `resolve()` exactly like a mapped drive, and a guard that fails when `.resolve()` reappears in the four files that produce or compare the stored form. The real thing is checked by hand on Windows: `subst U: C:\some\folder`, pick `U:\...` in the app, analyse a few videos.

## Datetime conventions

There are two kinds of datetimes in this codebase and they must never be mixed in arithmetic or comparison:

1. **Observational datetimes** are naive wall-clock time at the camera, in the project's local camera timezone (`Project.timezone`). They come from EXIF `DateTimeOriginal` on images or exiftool `QuickTime:CreateDate` and friends on videos, and are stored verbatim: no conversion, no offset attached at rest. Columns: `File.captured_at_local`, `Event.event_start_local`, `Event.event_end_local`, `Deployment.start_date_local` (Date), `Deployment.end_date_local` (Date).

2. **Audit datetimes** are tz-aware UTC, written via `datetime.now(UTC)` (never the deprecated `datetime.utcnow()`). They record when the server did something: row creation, job scheduling, human verification, folder re-link. Columns all end in `_utc` and are typed `DateTime(timezone=True)`, e.g. `Project.created_at_utc`, `Project.updated_at_utc`, `File.verified_at_utc`, `Detection.verified_at_utc`, `Job.started_at_utc`.

| Type | Naming | SQL type | Write site | Tz |
|------|--------|----------|------------|-----|
| Observational | `*_local` (or `*_date_local`) | `DateTime` / `Date` | EXIF / exiftool / event clustering | camera local, naive |
| Audit | `*_utc` | `DateTime(timezone=True)` | `datetime.now(UTC)` | UTC, tz-aware |

**Wire format.** Observational datetimes are serialized to the frontend as ISO 8601 with the UTC offset that applies to the project's timezone on *that file's local date* (so DST is resolved per-file). The field serializer lives in `backend/app/api/schemas/file.py` and `backend/app/api/schemas/event.py`; it reads the active project timezone from a `ContextVar` set at the top of each endpoint. The helper `app.utils.datetime_serialization.to_local_iso_with_offset` does the actual formatting. Audit datetimes serialize naturally because they're already tz-aware.

**Endpoints that return observational datetimes must be `async def`.** The `ContextVar` is set inside the endpoint body; for sync endpoints FastAPI runs the body in a threadpool, and the ContextVar set there is invisible to the response serialization stage that runs in the event loop task. `async def` keeps the body and serialization in the same task context. Pinned by tests in `backend/tests/api/test_datetime_wire_format.py`.

**Frontend rendering.** The UI must always show the camera's wall-clock time, not the viewer's browser-local time. `new Date(iso).toLocaleString(...)` parses the ISO string to an absolute UTC moment and then converts to the *viewer's* timezone, which silently shows wrong hours for any user not in the project's tz. Use `formatCameraDate` / `formatCameraTime` / `formatCameraDateTime` from `frontend/src/lib/datetime.ts` instead. They strip the offset and render the local components verbatim (locale-aware via `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with `timeZone: "UTC"` after the strip).

**Missing capture time is tolerated, not fatal.** `backend/app/ml/json_pipeline.py:load_json_to_database` reads each image's `DateTimeOriginal` (images) or exiftool `QuickTime:CreateDate` (videos). A file with no extractable timestamp is ingested with `captured_at_local=NULL` and recorded in `PipelineResult.skipped_missing_timestamp`; the worker logs the count and the job still succeeds. These files drop out of time-based features (events, trap nights, activity, trend charts) but are still detected and classified. This holds in both folder-run and project mode; neither rejects a deployment for missing dates. We never substitute `datetime.now(UTC)`, and we never reach for `fromtimestamp(mtime)` on our own: both silently lie about when the animal was actually there.

**The one mtime exception is explicit, per folder, and never silent.** Some cameras write no capture date anywhere. A Browning MJPG AVI is the worked example: the RIFF container has no `LIST INFO` chunk, so no `IDIT` or `ICRD`, nothing is embedded in the frames, and the date exists only burned into the pixels and in the filesystem timestamp. On the SD card that timestamp is right. Copied, it is not: the same test file read `09:55` on the card and `15:55:26 CEST` after a transfer, and a plain `cp` reset it to the day of the copy. Only the person holding the card can tell which, so it is their decision and not ours.

`DeploymentQueue.use_file_mtime_fallback` records that decision. The rules, all of which matter:

- **Offered only when there is no alternative.** The folder scan surfaces the checkbox only when `missing_datetime` is true, i.e. it found no capture date at all.
- **The user sees the result first.** `scan_folder` computes `mtime_start_date` / `mtime_end_date` over *every* media file (a `stat()` is not an EXIF decode) and only when the metadata pass came back empty, so those two fields are non-null exactly when the opt-in is shown. That displayed range is the whole safeguard: there is no heuristic behind it, and a folder copied last week reads as this week.
- **It fills gaps, never overrides.** `_resolve_capture_timestamp` puts mtime dead last, after the `addaxai-` filename marker. That ordering is load-bearing, not stylistic: `file_mtime_datetime` succeeds for every readable file, so anywhere earlier it would shadow every source below it.
- **One helper, three call sites.** `app/utils/media_dates.file_mtime_datetime` is used by the scanner, by `GET /api/deployments/file-datetime`, and by the ingest. The probe endpoint matters more than it looks: without it the Adjust-dates modal shows "unknown" for every file in such a folder and the offset can never be worked out.
- **The clock is the user's computer, not `Project.timezone`.** `fromtimestamp` gives the naive local time the OS file browser shows, which is exactly what the preview showed before they ticked the box. The preview endpoint takes a path and knows nothing about a project, so it could not do anything else even if we wanted to. A user whose cameras ran on another clock corrects the whole-hour shift with `datetime_offset_seconds`, which applies downstream of resolution and so lands on these values for free.
- **Nothing records that a date came this way.** Deliberate, and the main cost of the design: once ingested these are indistinguishable from camera dates. The only trace is one `logger.info` counting them per run, which is why that line stays even though it looks redundant.

This does not reinstate what commit `b9f23739` removed. That was an automatic mtime path plus a three-hour minimum-span heuristic guessing whether to trust it. The rule here is "never mtime unless the user looked at the result and said yes".

Fix the source data instead where you can. camtrapR's `fixDateTimeOriginal` writes a real `DateTimeOriginal` with exiftool and is the better answer, except exiftool refuses to write AVI at all, which is what forced this.

**Project timezone.** `Project.timezone` is a required IANA string (`"Europe/Amsterdam"`, `"UTC"`, `"Etc/GMT-3"`, etc.) describing what clock the cameras were configured to. The `TimezoneSelect` combobox in `frontend/src/components/ui/timezone-select.tsx` exposes both DST-aware regional zones and fixed-offset `Etc/GMT±N` zones for cameras set to "local winter time" (no DST). Used by the activity-pattern sun overlay (astral) and any future camtrap-dp export. Never used to convert stored datetimes.

## Observation cohorts

A row in `event_observations` is one cohort: a species in an event, a count, and optional `sex`, `life_stage` and `behavior`. Free text is `Event.notes`, one per event: a remark is about the visit, and one box per event beats one per row. Several rows per species per event are allowed since migration `a1b2c3d4e5f7`, which dropped `uq_event_obs_event_taxonomy`. The AI seeds one row per species with the demographics empty; a person sets them on that row in place, or presses Split (source minus one, new human-only row at one) and sets them per row. Every aggregate sums `effective_count` over rows, so the species total is the sum of its cohorts and nothing else in the app had to change.

**The rebuild carries the human layer by a seed rule.** `calculate_max_n_for_event` deletes and recreates an event's rows on every Labels-page edit, threshold change and regeneration. Per species, the *seed* is the prior AI row (`max_n > 0`), else a human-only row without demographics (a species added by hand that the AI now finds merges into the AI row, as before). The new AI row takes the seed's `human_count` and three demographic fields. Every other prior row a person touched (a `human_count`, or demographics on an AI row whose species the AI no longer sees) is recreated as a human-only row (`max_n = 0`, the count becoming a human count), split-off cohorts and duplicates included. Rows with demographics are never seeds, or "these 2 are juveniles" on an AI row would become juveniles plus a fresh unknown AI row after the next relabel. `PriorObs` (`crud/event_observation.py`) and `_snapshot_event_carry` (`crud/event.py`) snapshot the same fields for regeneration, and `deployment_split.py` copies them; forget one and a cohort silently loses its demographics on that path.

**What unconfirms.** `Event.confirmed` clears when the multiset of `(species, sex, life_stage, behavior, effective_count)` changed, in the rebuild and in `set_observation_attributes`. A note does not: it is commentary, not the observation, and Reset to AI leaves it alone too.

**Notes survive a regroup, counts do not, on purpose.** A count is a claim about one exact file set, so `generate_events_for_project` carries counts and the sign-off only onto a new event with the same files; a merged or split event gets the AI's numbers back. A note is text nobody can rebuild, so `_RegroupCarry.inherited_notes` gives every new event the notes of every old event it shares a file with: a split copies the note to each child, a merge joins them in time order, one per line. Misplaced beats lost. Deployment split copies the note to each child the same way.

**NULL means unknown, never a stored `"unknown"`.** Camtrap DP's `sex` and `lifeStage` enums have no such value (AddaxAI-Connect stores the literal and its exports fail the enum), every query would special-case it, and it is what turned a defaulted field into silent data loss over there. The vocabularies live once in `app/core/observation_attributes.py` and the API validates against them; `frontend/src/lib/observation-attributes.ts` mirrors them for the dropdowns, the same pairing as `confidence.py` / `confidence.ts`. `behavior` is free text in the standard; the fixed list is a product choice, kept identical to Connect so the two products' exports share a vocabulary.

**Order is rowid.** The rows have no timestamp and random ids, so `_rows_in_stored_order` reads them by SQLite rowid and the rebuild reinserts them in that order. That is what keeps the cohorts of a species where the user left them through a relabel. `list_event_observations` sorts species by AI MaxN and keeps rowid order inside a species.

Exports: `counts.csv` has one row per cohort with `sex`, `life_stage`, `behavior` and `event_notes` (repeated per row) after `count`; Camtrap DP's event rows fill `sex` / `lifeStage` / `behavior` from the row (the model's variant wins when both speak) and put the event's note in `observationComments` of each of its rows, since the standard has no event-level comment. Pinned by the cohort tests in `tests/test_max_n.py`, `tests/api/test_events.py`, `tests/api/test_export.py` and `test_a1b2c3d4e5f7_allows_two_cohorts_of_one_species`.

## Paired cameras

Dependent cameras, where one animal triggers more than one camera (facing pairs on a trail, both ends of a wildlife bridge; Camera Base's "station with two cameras"), are **one deployment** whose parent folder holds one subfolder per camera, with `Deployment.paired_cameras` on. There is no cross-deployment event model and no pair table; the feature is one boolean read in two places:

- `services/event_clustering.cluster_files_into_events(files, interval, *, paired_cameras)`: with the flag off, files bucket by parent folder before the time-gap split (a mixed backlog in one deployment never bridges SD cards); with it on, the whole deployment is one bucket, so an animal seen by both cameras is one event with the frames of both in time order. The flag has no default: every caller (event generation, the regroup preview, `build_smoother_input`) states it from the deployment row, so Event rows, the preview and the smoother can never disagree.
- `crud/trap_nights.py`: with the flag off, one interval per subfolder, summed (ten parallel cameras bundled as one deployment = 10 x 90); with it on, one interval from first to last capture (two cameras for 90 days = 90). The timeline reads the same intervals, so a paired deployment is one bar and one concurrent camera.

Everything else follows without change: the deployment has one results JSON, so the MegaDetector sequence smoother sees both cameras under one `seq_id`; `calculate_max_n_for_event` takes the maximum count in any single file, so two views of the same animal do not add up (the camtrap DP advice for paired cameras); export has one `deploymentID`. Camtrap DP defines a deployment as one camera, so a paired deployment writes `paired_cameras:true` into `deploymentTags`.

The flag is chosen on the queue entry (form checkbox or the `paired_cameras` CSV column) and copied onto the deployment by the worker, like `datetime_offset_seconds`. Editing it later goes through `crud/deployment.update_deployment`, which regenerates that deployment's events at once (`generate_events_for_deployment`, carrying confirmed counts by file set exactly like a project-wide regeneration) and clears `Project.postprocessing_settings_hash`, so `needs_reprocessing` is true until a reprocess re-smooths on the new grouping. The Edit deployment dialog starts that reprocess itself right after the PATCH (`startReprocessIfNeeded`, same job and `ApplySettingsModal` as saving analysis settings), so the user never has to remember it. An API caller that flips the flag without reprocessing leaves the labels smoothed on the old grouping until the next reprocess or analysis. A split of a paired deployment gives children with the flag off, since a child is one subfolder.

**Per-camera clock offsets.** `Deployment.camera_offsets` (and the queue copy) is `{"<subfolder>": seconds}`, added on top of `datetime_offset_seconds` for files whose first path segment under the deployment folder is that key. Root files get only the base. Both are baked into `File.captured_at_local` at ingest in `json_pipeline`. Editing goes through `update_deployment`: per camera delta, `_apply_offset_shift(..., path_prefix=<folder>/<cam>/, shift_events=False)` (exact `substr` prefix, not `LIKE`: `_` and `%` are wildcards), then the deployment's events are regenerated and the hash cleared, like a `paired_cameras` change. A removed key is a delta back to zero, so unpairing (the dialog sends `{}`) un-shifts. Keys are subfolder names and survive a relink. A split child folds its camera offset into its own `datetime_offset_seconds` and gets `{}`. The API refuses offsets on an unpaired deployment. The event detail route sets `FileWithDetections.camera` (None for root files and unpaired deployments) for the filmstrip badge.

Not built, on purpose: per-camera statistics inside a paired deployment, and Camera Base's left/right flank tagging.

## Species colours

Every species-coloured surface (Labels grid chips and boxes, Counts chips, video overlays, the map popup, the annotated JPEG export) reads one map, assigned per project by `assign_label_colors` in `backend/app/api/crud/label_colors.py`. The rule:

> Sort the species present in the project by taxonomy (class, order, family, genus, species, variant, name), then give rank `i` the palette entry `i mod 12`. The palette is ordered farthest-first, so consecutive entries contrast most, and consecutive ranks are the species most likely to be confused for each other.

"Present" is `present_label_rows` in `crud/event.py`, the same query the label filter offers, so a species can never be filterable without a colour or the other way round.

**Why not a hash of the label.** Until 2026-08-27 a label was hashed onto the brand gradient (teal to yellow). Hashing has no idea which other species are on screen, so with ten present species two of them land on the same or a neighbouring colour almost every time (the birthday problem), and the middle of that gradient is all olive, which a beta tester reported as "two shades of green on two rodents". `docs/guides/check-labels.mdx` promises the odd one out stands out by colour; only a scheme that looks at what is present can keep that promise.

**One implementation.** The frontend fetches `GET /api/projects/{id}/label-colors` (`useLabelColors`, mounted in `AppLayout` and `FolderRunLayout`) and `getSpeciesColor` only looks the key up, by `label_taxonomy_id` or lowercased label name. The export gets the same map through `detection_color(label, category, colors)`. There used to be a byte-for-byte Python mirror of the TypeScript hash, pinned by a test; that is exactly the kind of drift a single implementation removes. Do not add a colour algorithm on the frontend.

**Consequences to know.** Colours are per project, and a species that first appears through a relabel shifts the species after it by one slot, so `invalidateLabelQueries` refetches the map together with the label tree on every relabel. A key the map does not know renders neutral grey on screen (visible, never plausible) and a deterministic palette pick in the export, which can only happen for a label that passes the media threshold but not the counting threshold. Species 13 onwards wrap; that pairs a species with one twelve ranks away, which is almost never a relative. The category colours are excluded from the palette on purpose, so a species cannot be mistaken for an unlabelled box. Unclassified boxes carry a `__builtin__` taxonomy row named after their category (`taxonomy_db.ensure_builtin_taxonomy`); `assign_label_colors` hands those rows the category colour and no palette slot, because the frontend colours by `label_taxonomy_id` first and would otherwise paint a person box as a species while the export painted it orange.

## Insights (in-depth analytical views)

The Insights section in the sidebar hosts page-wide, scientifically-grounded visualisations that go deeper than the Dashboard's glanceable summary. Each view is its own route under `/projects/:id/insights/...` with its own filter bar and URL state persistence (via `frontend/src/lib/filter-url.ts`). The parent `insights` path redirects to the first child (`insights/map`) so clicking the parent does something useful. Future views slot in next to the existing ones.

### Map

`/projects/:id/insights/map`: per-deployment observation rate per 100 trap nights plotted on a base map. Three spatial views: trap-night-normalised rate, absolute observation count, and a heat-style density layer.

### Activity overlap

`/projects/:id/insights/activity-overlap`: 1- or 2-species temporal activity comparison modelled on the R `overlap` and `activity` packages. Two `SpeciesPicker` dropdowns drive the chart; with two species selected, the page also renders the Ridout & Linkie 2009 overlap coefficient Δ with a 1000-rep percentile bootstrap CI.

The math lives server-side in `backend/app/ml/activity_analysis.py` so it can be unit-tested in isolation:
- `fit_circular_kde()`: von Mises kernel density on a 240-point grid over [0, 24) hours. Post-normalized numerically rather than computing the closed-form `1/(2π·I₀(κ))`, which avoids a scipy dependency.
- `overlap_coefficient()`: Δ = ∫ min(f_a, f_b) dt over the grid.
- `bootstrap_overlap_ci()`: 1000-rep percentile bootstrap, fixed seed for deterministic results.
- `classify_diel()`: Bennie et al. 2014 ≥ 0.70 density-in-phase rule (diurnal / nocturnal / crepuscular / cathemeral). Falls back to a fixed 06:00-18:00 day window when sun bands are unavailable (polar latitudes, missing tz).

Sun-time mode (Vazquez et al. 2019 double-anchored transform) lives in `backend/app/ml/sun_time.py`:
- `per_date_sun_phases()`: looks up `(dawn, sunrise, sunset, dusk)` per unique observation date via astral, using the project's IANA timezone. Works for DST zones (`Europe/Amsterdam`) and fixed-offset zones (`UTC`, `Etc/GMT-3`) alike. Returns `None` for polar dates that astral refuses.
- `compute_anchors()` / `compute_anchor_bands()`: mean sunrise / sunset (and dawn / dusk) across every non-polar observation date. Both species share the same anchors so the two KDE curves sit in the same frame.
- `transform_to_sun_time()`: piecewise-linear double-anchor mapping: per-day sunrise / sunset stretch or compress to the anchor sunrise / sunset, with daylight and nighttime portions handled separately. Observations on polar dates are dropped and counted separately so the UI can surface the loss.

The CRUD function `get_activity_overlap()` in `backend/app/api/crud/statistics.py` reuses `_avg_site_location()` and `_compute_sun_bands()` from the existing activity-pattern endpoint, applies the project's `independence_interval` to event grouping (no per-plot override: the interval is shown as read-only metadata next to the chart), and returns one round-trip with both species' KDE densities, the rug-tick samples, the Δ block, the diel classifications, the clock-mode sun bands, the sun-mode anchor bands, and the effective `time_axis` (which silently downgrades to `clock` if the project has no site coordinates or every observation date is polar). Wire format and tz handling follow the conventions in the "Datetime conventions" section below.

## Resuming an interrupted analysis

An analysis is all-or-nothing per deployment: nothing reaches the database before phase 6, and the intermediate JSONs were wiped by the very action that restarts the run. A beta tester lost a 5,073-image folder to a power cut (2026-08-21) and asked for the checkpoints v6 had. The answer covers **image detection only**, which is where the hours go (measured: detection 3:12 against classification 0:44 for 2,281 images on an M-series Mac, and a far larger share on a CPU laptop).

**Three files in `<folder>/.addaxai/projects/<project_id>/`**, named in `app/ml/detection_checkpoint.py`, which is the one place that knows the rules:

| File | Written by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `md_checkpoint.json` | MegaDetector (`--checkpoint_frequency N --checkpoint_path P`) | results so far, rewritten every N images, deleted by MegaDetector when detection finishes |
| `md_checkpoint.meta.json` | us, before detection starts | what the checkpoint is valid for: detector id, image size, augment, image count |
| `detection_image.json` | phase 3 output | when whole, detection is done and phase 3 is skipped |

**One rule: the meta must match the current run exactly, else there is no checkpoint.** `inspect()` returns a `ResumeState` (partial with the count of finished images, or complete) only when `CheckpointMeta.read() == expected`. Any difference, or an unreadable meta, and the worker calls `discard()` and starts fresh, with one log line. A truncated JSON (crash mid-write) is a JSON error and reads as absent. No partial credit, no heuristics: the person changed a detection setting, so a fresh run is what they asked for. The meta itself is written atomically (`.tmp` + `os.replace`), so a crash during our own write cannot cost a good checkpoint.

**Frequency** is `checkpoint_frequency(image_count, batch_size)`: `max(500, image_count // 100)`, rounded up to a multiple of the batch size. 500 is v6's own example. The `// 100` exists because MegaDetector rewrites the whole results list at every checkpoint (copy to `_tmp`, write, delete `_tmp`), so the cost is quadratic in folder size; capping the count keeps a 100k-image folder at about a hundred rewrites. The batch multiple is not optional: in batch mode MegaDetector counts whole batches and writes only when `image_count % frequency == 0` (`run_detector_batch.py`, the batch loop), so a frequency of 500 with a batch size of 16 never fires. Worth reporting upstream.

**Why these two states and nothing more.** MegaDetector's resume (`--resume_from_checkpoint P`) loads the file as its results seed, skips every listed file (it forward-slashes both sides, so the match holds on Windows), appends the rest, and deletes `P` on success even when the path is explicit. So a checkpoint exists only while detection is unfinished. Once it finished, `detection_image.json` is the record, and a crash in classification or later leaves it whole. Both are read by the same `inspect()`; `detect_to_json` gets `images_done` so the progress row counts over the whole folder while MegaDetector's tqdm counts only what is left.

**What restarts on a resume.** Everything after detection: classification is a one-shot subprocess with temp in/out files (no partial output exists), best-frame selection and embeddings are cheap next to detection. Videos restart fully: `process_video` declares the three checkpoint options but never calls `write_checkpoint`, in the pinned 10.0.24 and on upstream `main` (checked 2026-08-31). If upstream ships it, it is three more flags in `video_detector.py`.

**Who keeps the files.**

- Cancel keeps them. The cancel handler never touched the artifacts folder, so cancel is a pause for free; the queue entry goes back to pending and the next Start continues on its own. The cancelled-state text says so.
- App quit keeps them, because `lifespan` now calls `kill_all_tracked()` first. Without that, the detector outlived the backend: `popen_group` starts it in its own session, uvicorn's SIGTERM never reached it, and it ran on for hours, finished, deleted its checkpoint and wrote its output into a temp dir nothing would read. The one shape still uncovered is the backend process alone dying hard (`kill -9`, OOM kill) while the detector lives on and self-cleans.
- "Run again" wipes them, unless the user chose Continue: `POST /api/folder-runs/{id}/rerun` with `keep_checkpoint` makes `reset_folder_run_data` pass `keep_names=CHECKPOINT_FILES` to `_delete_deployment_artifacts`, which then removes every other child of the project folder and skips the empty-parent roll-up. Every other caller of that helper keeps today's `rmtree`.
- A hard kill in projects mode used to leave the placeholder deployment behind (today's date, no files), which blocked re-adding the folder, and deleting it by hand wiped the checkpoint with it. `reconcile_interrupted_jobs` now deletes, for each stuck `processing` entry, the deployments in the same project with the same `folder_path` and no `File` rows, database only. That is exactly the placeholder; the only other zero-file source is `POST /api/deployments`, which nothing in the app calls and which never pairs with a processing entry.

**How the user meets it.** Folder runs: the failed-run dialog asks the lookup (`GET /api/folder-runs/lookup`), which returns `detection_resume` for a `failed` entry when `inspect()` succeeds against the *saved* detection settings and the picker's live `image_count` (falling back to the queue entry's, which the worker rewrote to the on-disk count before phase 3). The dialog only shows Continue while the form still holds those settings (`canContinue` in `FolderRunModelStep.tsx`), because a re-run persists the form first and the worker would otherwise discard the checkpoint the dialog just promised. Both entry paths lead to the same page: a new run that lands on a folder with a run already redirects to that run's setup step, because the new-run page used to call a failed run "already analysed" and its Re-run went through `force_new`, which deleted the checkpoint. Projects mode: retry is re-adding the folder, which lands under the same project id and therefore the same artifacts folder, so the worker continues on its own and the progress modal says "Continuing where detection stopped". The worker's own `inspect()` at run start is the decision in both modes; the dialog is a preview.

**Consequences to know.** A folder that gained or lost files since the crash has a different `image_count`, so it gets no Continue and starts fresh (logged). A file renamed or replaced in between keeps the count and so resumes; MegaDetector then carries the checkpoint entry of the old name along, and `detect_to_json` drops every entry whose file was not in the list it was given, or a file that no longer exists got a `files` row with detections. Queue folder paths are stored through `normalize_folder`, so a typed trailing slash cannot break the ghost rule or the folder-run lookup. `run_classification_on_json` rewrites `detection_image.json` with a plain `open(..., "w")`; a crash inside that write truncates the file, which `inspect()` reads as absent, so detection runs again for that rare window rather than reusing a broken file. The checkpoint sits on the user's own drive; a project deleted while a ghost's checkpoint remains leaves a few MB behind. MegaDetector prints one line per checkpoint into `backend.log` at INFO, and because its stdout is block-buffered in our pipe those lines can arrive only when it exits; the file itself is written on time.

## Best frame selection (videos)

After video detection (phase 1) and frame extraction, a single representative frame number is selected per video. The algorithm:

1. Score each frame by summing **every** detection's confidence (>= 0.3), whatever its category
2. Among confidence ties, prefer the largest union bbox area (within 90% of the best)
3. Blank videos, and videos whose detections are all below 0.3: the middle frame

**The decision reads the JSON only, and happens before anything is decoded.** `scoring.choose_frame_number` takes the detection list plus the frame count and returns a number. Ordering it this way is what keeps memory flat, and it is why there is no sharpness tier.

**How many frames you want decides how you fetch them.** Measured on real camera-trap clips: a seek costs ~85 ms, a sequentially walked frame ~1.6 ms, so **one seek is worth about 55 walked frames**. That single ratio is the whole rule, and it splits the two callers:

| Caller | Frames wanted | How |
|---|---|---|
| `best_frame.py`, and the classifier when a clip has nothing to crop | 1 | `read_frame_by_seek` |
| the classifier with crops (11 to 51 frames), the filmstrip (9) | many | `iter_wanted_frames`, walking |

Until 2026-08-03 everything walked, and `best_frame.py` carried a comment claiming it decoded "only the frame we are going to keep". That was false: it decoded every frame *up to* the one it kept. Since a video with no confident detection is sent to `total_frames // 2`, and blank is the majority of clips, it decoded **half of every empty video and discarded it**. On a beta tester's 1595-video run that was 85 minutes, 71% of the MegaDetector video detection time itself. This was invisible for two months because the May refactor (bulk frames to disk removed) and the July one (sharpness tier dropped, `wanted` shrank to two frames) both really did fix something, disk and memory respectively, and the comments they left described *retention* in language that reads like *work*.

**Seeking is verified, never trusted.** `read_frame_by_seek` refuses unless it can prove where it landed, and the caller then walks instead. Two gates, and the order matters: the range check (`0 <= n < frame_count`) decides from the container's own count before any backend is involved, so an out-of-range frame is refused without depending on how honestly a backend clamps; the `CAP_PROP_POS_FRAMES` check afterwards is the weaker one, because FFmpeg's seek sets that counter to whatever you asked for, so it mostly only catches a backend that does not implement the property at all. The consequence to hold onto: **a codec that seeks badly loses the speed-up, it never gets the wrong frame.** What neither gate catches is variable frame rate, where a seek targets a timestamp while MegaDetector numbers frames by counting decoded ones. Camera traps are effectively all constant frame rate; `backend/scripts/check_seek_accuracy.py` compares seeked pixels against walked pixels over a folder of real footage and is how a new camera make gets checked before it is trusted.

**This step must never run on the event loop.** It is minutes of work on a large folder and it used to be a plain synchronous call inside `_process_batch_job`, so the backend answered no HTTP request for the whole 85 minutes and the progress websocket could not report the very step blocking it. That is why it read as a hang rather than as a slow step. It is now `asyncio.to_thread` with a `video_frame_selection` progress phase and a per-video cancel check, and the `except Exception` around it re-raises `JobCancelledError` so a cancel is not swallowed as a non-fatal failure.

**The phase reports no compute device, on purpose.** Every other phase announces one because a model is loading somewhere; this one is CPU-bound video decoding sitting between two GPU phases, and a lone "CPU" row reads as a fault rather than as the ordinary fact that decoding is not GPU work. It is also why `send_progress` only carries `compute_device` forward *within* a phase and `useTaskProgress` clears it when a message omits one: both used to latch, so this phase inherited the detector's "GPU" and claimed hardware it never touched.

There was one, Laplacian variance, sitting below the area tier and also deciding blank videos outright. It required the pixels of every candidate frame, so the caller had to decode and hold each one before it could know which single frame it wanted: tens of full-size images in RAM for a 30-second clip. Measured across real deployments the tier never once broke a tie, because summed detection confidence decided every video that had detections at all. Paying that to settle a tiebreak that does not fire is a bad trade. For blank videos the middle frame is as defensible as the sharpest of three arbitrary samples, and beats the first frame, which is often the empty scene that triggered the camera.

**`best_frame_number` and the JPEG on disk must always describe the same frame.** Deciding before decoding means the chosen frame might never arrive, because containers over-report their frame count. When that happens both callers fall back to frame 0 *and move the stamped number with it*. This is also why the seek is verified rather than assumed, and why the tests assert the written JPEG's pixel content and not just its filename: a filename-only assertion passes happily when the frame came from the wrong place. Stamping the frame you wanted while writing the frame you got is the same class of bug as the crop-service one above: the Labels grid would draw one moment's boxes over another moment's picture.

See `backend/app/ml/best_frame.py` and `scoring.choose_frame_number`.

**Score on detection confidence, never on category and never on classification confidence.** Detection confidence is the only signal present in every detector and classifier combination, so one rule covers all of them, including detectors whose categories are not animal/person/vehicle (`fish`, `shark`, `turtle` need no code change). Two dead ends:

- *Scoring only animals* is what the classifier-fused path did until 2026-07-31. It took its candidates from the classification input, which `extract_animal_detections` restricts to category `"1"` above the classification gate. A clip containing only people therefore scored nothing, fell through to the blank-video fallback, and picked a frame with no idea where the person was. Since the Labels grid only shows best-frame detections, such a video could show no cards at all. It also made the chosen frame depend on whether a classifier was configured, because `best_frame.py` always scored every category.
- *Averaging detection and classification confidence* looks like the general rule and is not. It is really two rules, since a classifier-off run has no second number to average, so the same footage would get a different frame depending on a setting unrelated to how the frame looks. Classification confidence also has no fixed scale: SpeciesNet spreads mass over ~2500 classes and returns top-1 around 0.3 to 0.7 where a 20-class model returns 0.9+. Person and vehicle are never classified at all, so they would compete on a different scale within one frame. And a low classification score usually means two similar species, not a bad picture, which is the opposite of what best-frame is asking.

Both code paths (`best_frame.py` for classifier-off runs, `classification_worker._process_video_group` for classifier-on) score the same population through the same `choose_frame_number`, so they pick the same frame for the same video. The worker receives the population as `scoring_detections`, separate from the `items` it classifies. `tests/ml/test_best_frame_scoring.py` pins all of this, including that the two paths agree.

**A consequence worth knowing:** in a clip holding both, a confident person or vehicle can now win the frame over a marginal animal. Animals used to win by construction, because nothing else was scored.

That reads like a cost and the first real example was the opposite. A test clip of a person in camouflage inspecting a camera produced 31 person detections at 0.65 to 0.95 and exactly one animal box at 0.677 on a single frame, which the classifier then labelled "chimpanzee" at 0.29. Scoring animals only made that lone false positive the whole video: best frame 150, observation "chimpanzee". Scoring every category picked frame 420 and reported "person", which is what the video shows.

Weighting one category above the rest does not encode "animals matter more", it encodes "trust one detector output over its others". When the detector is wrong about the category, that is precisely backwards, and it is why re-introducing a category preference is not the safe-looking option it appears to be.

**Changing this needs a re-analysis to take effect.** `best_frame_number` is written once at load time, so existing deployments keep whatever frame the old rule chose. (Ingest does refresh it when a JSON is re-loaded onto an existing `File` row, so the stored frame never disagrees with the detections sitting beside it.)

**Changing the scoring here now changes `File.observation_type` too.** Since `6f7a8b9c0d1e` a video is summarised by its best frame, so the frame this function picks decides what the file is, not just which JPEG is shown. `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.3` in `scoring.py` is the reason a video only reads `blank` on a project threshold above roughly 0.6: the chosen frame carries the confidence mass. Move that floor and observation types move with it, silently, for new analyses only, with no migration to catch it.

**Storage:** No separate frame JPEG is saved; `best_frame_path` points to the frame inside `video_frames/`: `{deployment_folder}/.addaxai/video_frames/{video_name}/frame{N:06d}.jpg`. The `files` table stores `best_frame_number` (0-based index) and `best_frame_path` (absolute path to the JPEG). Both are `NULL` for images.

**Usage:** The best frame is the canonical image representation of a video. Use it anywhere you'd use a photo for an image file:
- Thumbnails in the UI
- Human verification workflows
- Depth estimation
- Any future per-file visual feature

If you're building a feature that works on images, check `file.best_frame_path` for videos instead of extracting frames yourself.

### The best frame is the only frame a video detection can be shown on

MegaDetector runs over every sampled frame, so a 30-second clip stores dozens of detections spread across dozens of frames. Only the best frame is written to disk as a JPEG. That makes one rule non-negotiable:

> a video detection is displayable only when `Detection.frame_number == File.best_frame_number`

Break it and nothing errors. `crop_service` happily crops the best frame at a bbox belonging to a different moment and returns a perfectly valid JPEG of the wrong place. On a clip of a person walking, 31 of 32 grid tiles were pictures of the background they had already left. The bug survived for months because a slow subject hides it completely: successive bboxes overlap, so the crops still contain the animal, just shifted, and they look right. Only a moving subject exposes it. If you are ever unsure whether a surface honours this, test it with a clip of something walking across the frame, never with a browsing deer.

Enforced in:

| Module | How |
|--------|-----|
| `services/crop_service.py` | `_resolve_image_path` returns `None` off the best frame |
| `ml/inference/similarity_script.py` | `_COMMON_JOINS` gates all three grid queries |
| `ml/embedding_utils.py` | `build_embedding_input` skips them (no pixels to embed) |
| `api/routers/labels.py` | `on_embeddable_surface` in the stats and unprocessed counts |
| `ml/postprocessing_outputs/annotated_copies.py` | one annotated still per video |
| `api/crud/event_observation.py` | off-best-frame species don't spawn observation rows |
| `api/crud/event.py` | the label filter list, and the detection counts behind the verification percentage |
| `api/crud/statistics.py` | the dashboard's per-species verification rows |
| `frontend/src/lib/detection-utils.ts` | `shouldDrawBbox` for every canvas and overlay |
| `api/crud/file.py`, `ml/json_pipeline.py`, `ml/postprocessing.py` | the three writers of `File.observation_type` |
| `api/crud/export.py`, `ml/postprocessing_outputs/{separate_folders,output_preview}.py` | the Files export species block, the folder a video is copied into, and its preview |

**Verified detections are the one exception.** They pass on any frame, in the grid query and in `rebuild_event_observations`. A human decision must never end up out of reach: the counts already honour a species verified on some frame, so the grid has to be able to show the card that count came from. Its thumbnail will be missing, which is the honest answer, and `CropCard`'s `onError` degrades to a plain tile.

**The off-best-frame detections are not junk, and are not deleted.** Their per-frame classifications are exactly what smoothing and taxonomic rollup consume, and they disagree a lot: one raccoon walking through a clip was read as northern raccoon, american badger, american badger, blank, virginia opossum, northern raccoon, blank on seven consecutive frames. Rollup turning that into one label is the system working. They also draw in `VideoPlayer`, which has the real frames. They are hidden from still surfaces only.

## Media copies of videos

The folder-run Save step copies a video as the file it is, whole and under its own name, the same as an image. Until 2026-09-03 it wrote the best-frame JPEG only (`<stem>_still.jpg`), to keep the output small and to give boxes and blur a picture to land on. Three users asked for the clips back in the first week of v7: they sort media into species folders to keep the animal clips apart from the junk they delete, which is what legacy v6 did (verified in `v6.37:AddaxAI_GUI.py`, `move_files`: one `shutil.copy2` for images and videos alike; visualise, crop and plot were images only and warned as much). One rule, said on the Save step in the same words: copies are your files; boxes and blur are drawn on images, and a video gets a still with the boxes beside it.

**Blur is the one exception.** A blurred still beside the unblurred clip it came from is no anonymisation, so with blur on a video is written as its blurred still only. `videos_as_stills` on `separate_into_folders` and `build_output_preview` carries it, the worker passes `anonymise` into it, and the blur row's caption says so. Nothing else sets it; do not grow it into a general "videos as stills" toggle unless someone asks.

**The container is copied by separation even in deferred mode.** When boxes or blur run, separation normally plans the destinations and leaves the bytes to `annotated_copies` (`place_files=False`). That module only writes JPEGs, so it can put the still beside a video but never the video itself: `separate_into_folders` copies any non-image destination regardless of `place_files`, and `annotated_copies` skips the plain-copy fallback for a placed container (nothing to draw means no still, not a missing file). Separation allocates the still's name too (`<container stem>_still.jpg`, through the same `_unique_destination` and `reserved` set as every other name) and records it on the context for annotation to read. A `.jpg` suffix swap collided with cameras that shoot `DSCF0100.jpg` beside `DSCF0100.mp4`, and an unreserved `_still` name let two clips with one stem (`clip.mp4`, `clip.MOV`) or a photo named like a still overwrite it, silently.

**Placement is still decided by the best frame.** The folder a clip lands in comes from the same visible-surface rule as its card, its row in the Files export and the still beside it (see "What a file is about"). The still shows that frame, so it normally shows why the clip is there; the one exception is a clip filed by a verified box on another frame, which gets no still because its best frame has nothing to draw. A clip whose best frame is empty but has a confident box elsewhere files under `blank/`, consistent with everything else that describes it. No EXIF tags go into containers (`is_image_path`).

**There is no move mode, and the dead one was removed.** Legacy offered move; v7 never wired it up and the branch went with this change. Four reasons, all in the code: the worker wipes `addaxai-media` before every re-save using the marker as proof of ownership, so moved originals would be deleted one save later; the output folder defaults to the source folder, so a move would move originals into a subfolder of themselves while the recognition JSON's relative paths, the detection checkpoint and the video-frame cache all hang off the source tree; across drives `shutil.move` is copy plus delete anyway; and the FAQ and the Save step promise originals are never moved. A user who wants the source gone deletes it themselves, once, after checking the copies.

**Cost to know.** Re-saving wipes and re-copies every clip, and cancel is only honoured between modules, so a large video copy runs to the end of its module. Pinned by the video tests in `tests/ml/test_separate_folders_placement.py`, `tests/ml/test_annotated_copies.py`, `tests/ml/test_output_preview.py`, the `anonymise` preview test in `tests/api/test_folder_runs.py` and the two worker end-to-end tests in `tests/test_save_outputs_worker.py`.

## Mixed pixel format videos (Bushnell AVIs)

Some cameras encode the first frame of every clip in a different pixel format than the rest. Bushnell MJPEG AVIs are the known case: frame 0 is `yuvj422p`, every later frame `yuvj420p` (`ffprobe -select_streams v:0 -show_entries frame=pix_fmt -of csv=p=0 <file>` shows the transition). OpenCV's FFmpeg wrapper builds its BGR conversion context from the first frame a capture converts and only rebuilds it when the *dimensions* change (`cap_ffmpeg_impl.hpp`, the `img_convert_ctx` condition), never on a pixel format change. Converting frame 0 and then a later frame on one capture therefore reads the later frame with a wrong plane layout. The symptom differs per platform, which is what made it confusing: Windows and Linux die with an access violation (exit code 3221225477 / SIGSEGV), macOS survives the overread and silently renders corrupted frames (green/blue bands; frame 0 clean, everything after garbage). Every opencv-python from 4.8 to 5.0 is affected; a version pin is not a fix. Plain `ffmpeg` decodes the files fine, so the files are valid and re-encoding them (what beta testers did with HandBrake) merely hides the bug and costs them their file timestamps.

Two defences, both small:

1. **Frame 0 never shares a capture with later frames.** `iter_wanted_frames` in `ml/inference/video_iter.py` reads frame 0 on a dedicated capture and only `grab()`s it (demux + decode, no conversion) on the shared walk. A capture that converts only frame 0, or only frames >= 1, never mixes formats. This covers every in-process decode surface (best frames, classifier crops, filmstrips) on every platform, with correct full-range colours. `read_frame_by_seek` was already safe: the context is built lazily from the first *converted* frame, so a fresh capture that seeks past frame 0 builds a matching context (verified empirically).
2. **The detection subprocess retries once on the crash.** `process_video` is megadetector's code walking from frame 0, out of our reach. `video_detector.py` catches exit code 3221225477 and reruns the whole folder once with `OPENCV_VIDEOIO_PRIORITY_FFMPEG=0`, which makes cv2 pick MSMF on Windows. MSMF decodes these files with exact frame counts and working seeks, but reads the full-range JPEG data as limited-range, crushing shadows a little; that only affects the detector's input frames, never anything user-visible, and only for folders that actually crashed.

**Known gaps, deliberately open (YAGNI until reported):** on macOS the detector's own input frames stay silently colour-corrupted for such files (detection still works; everything user-visible is fixed by defence 1). On Linux the detection subprocess still dies, because the Linux opencv wheel has no other file backend to fall back to. Both wait for the upstream OpenCV fix ([opencv/opencv#29699](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/29699), filed with a 196 KB stream-copy repro; advisory for other wrappers at [agentmorris/MegaDetector#237](https://github.com/agentmorris/MegaDetector/issues/237)) or a real user report.

Pinned by `tests/ml/test_video_detector_retry.py` and the frame-0 pixel assertions in `tests/ml/test_video_iter.py`. The end-to-end proof is a folder run over real Bushnell files on a Windows machine, which is how this was verified.

## Keeping installed models up to date

A model that is already downloaded is never re-fetched by the normal flows: `check_weights_ready` only tests that the weights file exists, so once the `.pt` is on disk, preparing the model downloads nothing. That is fine for weights and wrong for everything else in the repo, because a fixed `inference.py` or a corrected `taxonomy.csv` would never reach anyone who already had the model.

On startup, `ModelCatalogUpdater.sync()` therefore asks HuggingFace for one file listing per **installed** model (a catalog stub with no weights next to it costs no request) and compares it to what is on disk. `find_stale_files` in `backend/app/ml/model_storage.py` is the whole rule:

- **LFS files are skipped.** Those are the weights. HuggingFace's `blob_id` for an LFS file is the hash of the pointer stub rather than of the content, so comparing it would report every install as stale forever, and hashing the real file means reading gigabytes on every launch. Weights are versioned by `model_id` instead: re-uploading weights in place under the same id will not be noticed, so bump the id (`EUR-DF-v1-1` through `v1-4`, `AFR-DFV-v1` to `v2`).
- **Documentation and OS litter are skipped** by basename: `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md`, `.gitattributes`, `.DS_Store`, `manifest.json`.
- **Everything else is compared by git blob SHA-1**, which is exactly what `blob_id` holds for a non-LFS file, so nothing is downloaded to reach a verdict. That covers `inference.py`, `taxonomy.csv`, `taxon-mapping.csv`, class lists, geofence JSON, `hubconf.py` and the vendored `dinov2/` and `dinov3/` trees with no allowlist to maintain. Covering all of them rather than just the obvious two matters: commits routinely touch several files at once, and shipping half of one leaves new code reading an old data file.

`POST /api/ml/models/{id}/update` recomputes the stale set server-side (a client can never name a path) and downloads only those files, via the `include` and `overwrite` options on the HF downloader. `overwrite` is not decoration: the downloader otherwise skips any file whose byte size already matches, so an upstream edit of the same length would be skipped by the very call that came to replace it.

**Nothing about upstream is recorded on disk.** An earlier design stored an `hf_revision_sha` in the local `manifest.json`, which `write_manifest` then overwrote from the catalog on the next launch, so the check silently never fired and every model was logged as refreshed forever. Comparing the files themselves has no state to fall out of date, works on an install that predates the feature, and self-heals a partial download. Keep it that way: if you add a local-only key to `manifest.json`, you reintroduce that bug.

**`~/AddaxAI/models` is a managed cache, not a source tree.** Editing a model's `inference.py` in place now shows up as an available update on every launch, and applying it overwrites your edit with no backup.

### Environment drift is answered per request, model drift is not

`GET /api/ml/updates` returns two lists and they are computed at different times, on purpose.

`drifted_models` is the startup snapshot in `app.state.model_updates`. Answering it needs HuggingFace, so it cannot be recomputed per request, and `POST /api/ml/models/{id}/update` patches the model it just fixed out of the stored list.

`drifted_envs` is recomputed by `find_drifted_envs()` on every request. It reads a 64-byte sentinel and hashes a 2.7 KB YAML per env, all local, so the cost does not justify a cache, and a cache here is wrong rather than merely stale: rebuilding a drifted env rewrites `.addaxai-yaml-sha256`, but the snapshot kept saying "drifted" until the next launch. The frontend caches the response with `staleTime: Infinity`, so nothing refetched inside a session, but a window reload builds a new query client, asked again, and got the same stale answer. The user was told to rebuild the environment they had just spent a minute rebuilding, over and over, and `EnvRebuildButton` could only hide it with React state that the next reload threw away.

The recomputed list is returned, never written back into `app.state`: the stored snapshot is what the startup log line `N env(s) drifted` described, and it stays that.

`ADDAXAI_DISABLE_MODEL_UPDATES` still covers both. It turns off the whole notice, so env drift must not slip past it on its own.

## Reaching HuggingFace through something that is not HuggingFace

`Settings.hf_base_url` is the single source for every HuggingFace request, so a mirror or a company repository manager (Artifactory, Nexus) covers all of them or none. `ADDAXAI_HF_TOKEN` rides along for an endpoint that will not serve anonymously; our own repos are public, so it is unset for everyone else.

**The token has to be attached twice, because two clients do the work.** `huggingface_hub` handles the metadata calls and reads the token itself, but the file downloads are plain `requests`, so a token set only on the first client lists a repo perfectly and 401s every file in it. `hf_auth_headers()` in `hf_downloader.py` is the one helper both raw-HTTP sites use (the downloader session and the taxonomy fetch), and `HfApi(token=...)` is passed explicitly so the value comes from `Settings` rather than from whatever `HF_TOKEN` happens to be. requests drops the header again on a redirect to another host (`Session.rebuild_auth`), which is what keeps a corporate token off `us.aws.cdn.hf.co` when the endpoint is the real HuggingFace.

**Only two of the four calls are fatal on the far end.** `GET /api/models/{repo}/tree/{rev}` (the file listing; huggingface_hub 1.x resolves `list_repo_files` through `list_repo_tree`, not through the older model-info route) and `GET /{repo}/resolve/{rev}/{path}`. `paths-info` only sizes the progress bar, `model_info(files_metadata=True)` only feeds the staleness check, and both are caught and degrade. So a proxy answering those two is enough, which is worth knowing before promising a user their repository manager will work.

### The relay, for networks that block HuggingFace outright

Some web filters forbid `huggingface.co` and `*.hf.co` as a category (a US state laptop on 2026-09-11: "AI content", on every network, hotspot included), and only IT can change that. `infra/hf-relay/worker.js` is our own Cloudflare Worker that forwards requests for the `Addax-Data-Science` repos to huggingface.co, follows the CDN redirect itself and streams the answer back. It stores nothing, so there is no second copy of any model to keep in sync: a fixed `inference.py` on HuggingFace is live through the relay the same second. Its address is `DEFAULT_HF_FALLBACK_ENDPOINT` in `config.py` (`ADDAXAI_HF_FALLBACK_ENDPOINT` overrides it).

`_download_repo_with_relay` in `model_storage.py` is the whole rule. Every download goes to HuggingFace first. Only `NetworkBlockedError`, the block-page signal, sends the same download once through the relay, and only when `Settings.hf_fallback_url` is set, which it is not when the user configured their own mirror through `ADDAXAI_HF_ENDPOINT`: that is where their organisation allows downloads from, and a block page from it must not be answered by routing around it. If the relay cannot help either (blocked too, unreachable, over its daily quota), the *original* error is raised, so the wizard keeps naming huggingface.co, the host IT has to allow, instead of falling back to a generic "Download failed". A plain download failure never reaches the relay. The Worker strips the client's `Authorization` header: our repos are public, and a user's own `HF_TOKEN` must not travel through it.

Not covered, on purpose: the startup staleness check and the catalog's `taxonomy.csv` fetch. Both degrade quietly, and `taxonomy.csv` is in the repo download anyway. A user behind such a filter gets no "update available" notices until IT opens the hosts.

The Worker runs on the free plan (no card; 100,000 requests a day, then it errors until midnight UTC, never a bill). One model download is roughly 15 to 30 requests. Test it locally with `npx wrangler dev --local` in a scratch folder (a `compatibility_date` newer than the local runtime refuses to start), then run the two curl checks from the locked-down docs page against `http://127.0.0.1:8787` and a real `download_repo` with `ADDAXAI_HF_ENDPOINT` pointed at it. Pinned by `tests/ml/test_hf_relay_fallback.py`.

## The catalog we ship as a fallback

`models.json` is bundled by `backend.spec` and read by `_bundled_catalog_path()` when the remote catalog cannot be fetched. **It is a fallback, not a cache: never write the fetched catalog over it.** That would turn the one file describing what this build shipped with into a copy of whatever upstream said last, and the guarantee it exists to give (an install can always name its own models) with it.

Without it, a first launch on a network that blocks `raw.githubusercontent.com` downloaded every weight file successfully and then showed no models at all, because `manifest.json` is written from the catalog and from nowhere else, and `ManifestManager` skips any model directory without one. The symptom lands far from the cause, as **"Classification model '<id>' not found"** from `POST /api/projects`.

## The wheel we ship instead of downloading

`backend/app/ml/pip-wheels/` holds `ultralytics_yolov5-0.1.1-py3-none-any.whl`, the one third-party binary in the repo. `substitute_bundled_wheels` in `environment_manager.py` rewrites the YAML's URL to that local copy when it writes the build copy for micromamba, so the environment build fetches it from disk on every platform.

**Why it cannot be a download.** `megadetector` depends on `ultralytics-yolov5==0.1.1`, whose PyPI release is sdist-only, and that sdist's `setup.py` fetches a README from GitHub at build time, which dies on machines that cannot load the Windows certificate store. So it has to be a wheel, and the only wheel is one we built. Pinning it by URL then created a failure no user could work around: **pip fetches a direct-URL requirement literally**, and `--index-url`, `--extra-index-url` and `--find-links` only steer index resolution. A blocked host therefore kills the whole environment build regardless of configuration. That is what stopped setup in mainland China (2026-08-13): hf-mirror.com answers `/resolve/` with a 308 back to the blocked huggingface.co, so even a correctly configured mirror ended at `WinError 10054`. Every other remote file the app wants goes through `huggingface_hub`, which honours the mirror, which is why this one line was the only casualty.

**The YAMLs still carry the URL and are not edited.** Three reasons, and the first is the load-bearing one: `hash_yaml_file` hashes the *bundled* YAML, so editing those six files would tell every existing user their environment drifted and offer them a rebuild that takes tens of minutes, to install a byte-identical package. The URL also records where the file came from, and the `#sha256=` fragment survives the rewrite, so pip verifies the local copy (confirmed: the installed `direct_url.json` records the hash).

**`Path(__file__).parent` is deliberate**, matching `get_env_yaml_path` and the worker scripts. PyInstaller's `datas = [('app', 'app')]` is a whole-tree copy, so anything under `backend/app/` ships and needs no spec entry, and `electron-builder` copies the entire PyInstaller output through `extraResources`. Nothing else has to be told about a new wheel. Note the directory is `pip-wheels` and not `wheels`, which `.gitignore` would silently swallow.

**A missing wheel raises rather than falling back to the URL.** A fallback would work everywhere except the networks this exists for, so the bug would only ever surface for the users who cannot report it easily.

`tests/ml/test_bundled_wheels.py` keeps the YAML the single source of truth: it reads the filename and sha256 out of every env YAML and checks the shipped file matches, fails if a pinned wheel is absent, and fails if a shipped wheel is pinned by nothing. Change the YAML pin first and the test tells you which file to put in place.

## Why the PyTorch index is ours to replace

`ADDAXAI_PYTORCH_INDEX_URL` swaps `https://download.pytorch.org/whl/` in the YAML copy for a mirror, keeping whatever CUDA suffix follows so one replacement covers the cu128 and cu118 lines.

**pip has no index priority**, and that is the whole reason this exists. Every index in the set is equal and pip picks whichever candidate it likes, so a mirror added through `pip.ini` competes with our `--extra-index-url` rather than replacing it. A user in mainland China can configure a fast mirror correctly and still be served the 3.4 GB torch wheel from the slow origin. Our entry is the one thing they cannot remove, so removing it is the only lever that works.

**`--find-links` is not that lever, and the docs used to say it was.** Verified with pip 26: an identical, correctly named wheel in a `--find-links` directory is ignored whenever an index also offers that version (`Downloading ...` from the network), and only used with `--no-index` (`Processing /path/...`). Telling users to drop a pre-downloaded wheel into a folder does nothing. That advice cost a beta tester in China an hour of stalled setup on 2026-08-15 before it was removed.

Unset, the substitution is a no-op, so nothing changes outside China. `tests/ml/test_pytorch_index.py` fails if a shipped YAML ever spells the index differently, since a plain prefix swap would silently miss it.

## What a download leaves behind when it does not finish

Two rules in `download_weights`, and the difference between them is deliberate:

| Outcome | What happens to the model directory |
|---|---|
| Failed | Nothing is removed. A retry fetches only what is missing. |
| Cancelled | Every downloaded file is removed, `manifest.json` is kept. |

**A failed download must not clean up.** `download_file` streams every file to a `.tmp` sibling and only `replace()`s it into place once it is complete and its size matches, so a file sitting at its final path is whole, and the size check at the top of `download_file` skips it next time. There is no resume *within* a file: an interrupted file restarts from byte 0, so what a retry saves is whole files, which for a model is nearly all of the bytes.

This used to `shutil.rmtree` the whole directory. That was written in December 2025 for a downloader that streamed straight to the final path and could therefore leave truncated files behind; the `.tmp` plus atomic rename that landed two weeks later removed that failure mode, and the wipe was never revisited. On 2026-08-12 it cost a beta run twice: one 12 KB `inference.py` that could not resolve `huggingface.co` deleted the 1.13 GB weights file that had downloaded perfectly beside it, so the retry paid for the whole model again, and it deleted `manifest.json`.

**`manifest.json` is never deleted by either path.** It is written from `models.json` by the catalog updater, no HF repo ships one (it is in `_IGNORED_REPO_FILES`), so a download can remove it but nothing except the next launch's `sync()` puts it back. Without it `ManifestManager` skips the directory entirely, and the model is gone from the catalog while its weights sit on disk. The symptom appears far from the cause: `POST /api/projects` refuses with **"Classification model '<id>' not found"**, and because `routers/ml_models.py` holds a process-lifetime `ManifestManager` cache while `routers/projects.py` builds a fresh one per request, the model still lists as installed and still reports "prepared successfully" in the same session. `_clear_downloaded_files` is the one cleanup helper, and the only place that deletes selectively inside a model directory. The Settings reset is not an exception: it removes the whole `models/` tree (`_WIPE_DIRS` in `routers/setup.py`), which the next launch's `sync()` rebuilds from scratch.

**One transient failure no longer fails a whole download.** The `requests` session carries urllib3's default `Retry(total=0)`, so a single DNS or connection blip on any one file used to end the run. `download_file` now makes `_FILE_ATTEMPTS` (3) attempts per file with a 1s then 2s pause, and re-checks `should_cancel` before each retry. Files at or above `_PARALLEL_MIN_BYTES` effectively had a second chance already, since a failed range falls back to a single connection; this gives every file the same. The cost is that a link which dies at 90% repeatedly now re-transfers up to three times instead of failing to the user after one, which is the right trade until someone reports otherwise. Byte-range resume within a file is the real fix and is not built (YAGNI).

Pinned by `tests/ml/test_download_cleanup.py` and the retry tests in `tests/ml/test_hf_downloader.py`.

## Creating a custom classification model

To add a new classification model to AddaxAI, create an `inference.py` file in your model's directory that implements the `ModelInference` class.

**Template:** See `/backend/templates/inference_template.py` for a complete template with examples.

**Required interface:**
```python
class ModelInference:
    def __init__(self, model_dir: Path, model_path: Path):
        # Store paths and initialize
        pass

    def check_gpu(self) -> bool:
        # Return True if GPU available
        pass

    def load_model(self) -> None:
        # Load model once at startup
        pass

    def get_crop(self, image: Image.Image, bbox: tuple[float, float, float, float]) -> Image.Image:
        # Crop and preprocess image for your model
        pass

    def get_classification(self, crop: Image.Image) -> list[tuple[str, float]]:
        # Return [(class_name, confidence), ...] for ALL classes
        pass

    def get_class_names(self) -> dict[str, str]:
        # Return {"1": "label1", "2": "label2", ...} (1-indexed)
        pass
```

**Benefits of class-based approach:**
- No global variables or `global` keyword needed
- Clear ownership (`self.model`)
- Framework-agnostic (works with PyTorch, Keras, JAX, TensorFlow, etc.)
- IDE autocomplete and type checking work properly

**Examples:**
- NAM-ADS-v1: YOLOv8 (PyTorch) - `/Users/peter/AddaxAI/models/cls/NAM-ADS-v1/inference.py`
- TAS-BB-v1: MEWC-Keras (Keras/JAX) - `/Users/peter/AddaxAI/models/cls/TAS-BB-v1/inference.py`

## Label taxonomy and the hierarchical filter tree

The label filter in the UI can render as either a flat multiselect or a hierarchical tree (class > order > family > genus > species). The tree is built from the `label_taxonomy` table. If no taxonomy rows exist for a project's classification model, the frontend falls back to the flat list.

### Database table: `label_taxonomy`

See `backend/app/models/label_taxonomy.py`.

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `classification_model_id` | Links to the classification model |
| `name` | Display label, **must match `Detection.label`** (this is the join key) |
| `taxon_class` .. `taxon_species` | Formal taxonomy ranks (nullable) |
| `level` | Most specific non-empty rank: `"class"`, `"order"`, `"family"`, `"genus"`, or `"species"` |
| `is_custom` | `True` for user-created entries, `False` for model-sourced entries |

Unique constraint: `(classification_model_id, name)`. All taxonomy functions are idempotent: calling them twice inserts 0 the second time.

`Detection.label` is a plain text field, **not** a foreign key. The tree builder matches it against `label_taxonomy.name` by string equality. This means the `name` value must exactly match whatever string ends up in `Detection.label`.

### How taxonomy gets populated

Taxonomy is populated automatically during two worker phases. All population functions live in `backend/app/ml/taxonomy_db.py`.

#### 1. Custom models with `taxonomy.csv`

Custom classification models (e.g. EUR-DF, NAM-ADS) ship a `taxonomy.csv` alongside their weights:

```csv
model_class,class,order,family,genus,species
leopard,mammalia,carnivora,felidae,panthera,pardus
bird,aves,,,,
```

`populate_taxonomy_from_csv(model_id, csv_path, db)` reads this file and inserts one row per line. The `model_class` column becomes `label_taxonomy.name`. Entries with only partial taxonomy (e.g. "bird" with just `class=aves`) get `level="class"`.

#### 2. Taxonomic rollup entries

When taxonomic rollup is enabled and a detection's top-1 confidence is below threshold, confidences are summed up the taxonomy tree. If a higher-level taxon (e.g. "felidae" at family level) crosses the threshold, `Detection.label` is set to that taxon name.

**The label is the model's own class when it has one for that taxon.** `load_taxon_class_names` maps every non-variant class to the taxon it *is* (`("family", "aves;galliformes;phasianidae;;")` to `family phasianidae (grouse)`), and `_format_rollup_label` uses that before inventing `genus species` or a bare taxon. This is what the official pipeline does through its `taxonomy_map`, where every ancestor is itself a label (a rollup to aves reads "bird"). Without it a confident "grouse" came back as "phasianidae", WUSA's "fox" as "vulpes", and a sex-age model produced both "odocoileus hemionus (mule deer)" and a rolled-up "odocoileus hemionus": two folders for one deer. Two classes on one chain ("bird" and "raptor" both filed as aves) make the taxon ambiguous, so it falls back to the bare taxon rather than picking one. A model whose species exists only as variants (red fox adult / juvenile, no plain red fox) still gets "vulpes vulpes". Only the label string is affected: which level wins and its confidence are the mechanism's, and stay byte for byte as reverse engineered from `run_md_and_speciesnet`.

`add_rollup_taxonomy_entry(model_id, name, level, taxonomy_lookup, db)` inserts a new `label_taxonomy` row for the rolled-up label so it appears in the tree under the correct branch. Called from `backend/app/ml/postprocessing.py` for each new rolled-up label.

### Where population is triggered

Both workers call `populate_taxonomy_from_csv` when a `taxonomy.csv` exists in the model directory:

| Worker | When | Code location |
|--------|------|---------------|
| `detection_worker.py` | After loading results to DB (phase 6) | ~line 520 |
| `postprocessing_worker.py` | After reprocessing all deployments | ~line 174 |

```python
if taxonomy_csv.exists():
    populate_taxonomy_from_csv(model_id, taxonomy_csv, db)
```

The detection worker runs this once per deployment. The postprocessing worker runs it when reprocessing (e.g. after changing model or settings). Since all functions are idempotent, running them multiple times is safe.

### How the filter tree is built

`build_label_filter_tree()` in `backend/app/api/crud/label_tree.py`:

1. Queries which labels actually have detections in the project
2. Joins against `label_taxonomy` to get taxonomy columns
3. Builds the hierarchy: class > order > family > genus > species
4. Annotates each leaf with detection or event counts
5. Labels with no taxonomy match go under an `"__other__"` node
6. Returns `null` if no taxonomy rows exist (frontend shows flat list)

Exposed via `GET /api/events/label-tree?project_id=<id>&count_by=<event|detection>`.

### The variant rank

Some models predict one level below species (adult vs juvenile fox). Two rules cover the whole feature:

1. **Variant is one more optional rank below species.** One nullable column `label_taxonomy.taxon_variant`, one `level` value `"variant"`, and one extra rung appended to every list that walks ranks: `TAXONOMY_LEVELS` in `taxonomy_db.py`, `_TAXONOMIC_RANK_ORDER` in `separate_folders.py`, `_TAXON_RANK_INDEX` in `similarity_script.py`, the two tree builders, `_taxon_ranks` in `crud/export.py`. If you add a new rank walker, it gets the rung too.
2. **Both display names must be unique per class within a model.** The common name already is (from the label: "Red fox adult"). The variant makes the scientific one unique: `V. vulpes (adult)`, formatted only in `format_scientific_name_from_taxonomy_row`.

The CSV contract: an optional `variant` column in `taxonomy.csv`, lowercase free-form ("adult", "juvenile", "male"), empty means no variant. `species` stays the epithet only. `resolve_taxonomy_gbif.py` passes it through verbatim and never sends it to GBIF.

Consequences that follow from rule 2 and are easy to get wrong:

- **Grouping at species rank must use the binomial built from the rank columns** (`species_binomial` / `species_rank_scientific_sql` in `taxonomic_rank.py`), never the row's own `scientific_name`, which names the leaf and can sit below species. That is what merges adult and juvenile into one species bucket. A merged bucket's common-mode name falls back to the binomial: a variant row has no species-level common name, the same way genus and family buckets read Latin in both modes.
- **"Most specific" needs no change anywhere**: the qualified scientific name is unique, so variants show separately by construction.
- **Camtrap DP never sees a qualified name.** `scientificName` gets the plain binomial; the variant fills `lifeStage` (adult / subadult / juvenile) or `sex` (female / male), else rides in `observationComments` (`_camtrap_variant_fields` in `crud/export.py`).

Two deliberate non-rungs:

- **The rollup does not walk a variant tier** (`TAXONOMY_LEVELS` in `taxonomic_rollup.py` stays at five). Variant values are not taxa; summing "adult" across species would be wrong. Variant siblings share genus and species, so the species-first Path B walk already merges them. Related: rollup sums are keyed by the full ancestor chain, never the bare taxon value, because species epithets repeat across genera (four `canadensis` classes in one real model) and bare-value keys merged them.
- **The excluded-class rollup (Path A) considers the species level, gated on backing.** A species candidate counts only when at least one *included* class maps to its exact chain, so excluding one variant lands its detections on the species the sibling still backs ("red fox juvenile" excluded gives "vulpes vulpes"), while a geofence-banned whole species has no included class on its chain and falls to family exactly as before. Genus stays skipped, matching the official SpeciesNet walk.
- **Rank pickers have no "Variant" entry.** "Most specific" already shows variants; a variant rank would duplicate it.

Caveat: event smoothing (megadetector upstream) compares classes by their cleaned taxonomy strings, which are identical for variants of one species, so smoothing can reassign labels between variants within an event. Measured on a real 16-image run of the first variant model: the "normal" preset changed nothing, the "aggressive" preset rewrote 4 of 16 labels (variants flipped in both directions, and species-level rollup rows propagated down to a variant). That is the same trade smoothing already makes between species, so it is documented, not patched.

Trees stay unchanged for models without variants: species becomes a parent node only when a variant sits below it. `tests/api/test_label_tree.py` and `tests/ml/test_taxonomy_parser.py` pin both shapes.

### The `is_custom` flag

All model-sourced entries (CSV, JSON, rollup) set `is_custom=False`. The flag exists for UI-driven taxonomy creation where users can add custom labels with taxonomy info. Custom entries work identically in the tree builder: it queries all `label_taxonomy` rows for the model regardless of `is_custom`.

### Rules

**No ad-hoc database fixes.** Do not run one-time scripts to patch database state. If data is stale or incorrect, fix the code that produces it. The data will be corrected when the user re-runs the relevant operation (analysis, reprocessing, taxonomy population). The app must handle its own data integrity.

**Never overwrite verified detections.** When a user manually verifies or relabels a detection (`Detection.verified == True`), that human judgment takes priority over any machine output. Postprocessing, reprocessing, taxonomic rollup, smoothing, and any other automatic pipeline must skip verified detections. If you are writing code that updates `Detection.label`, `Detection.label_confidence`, or `Detection.category`, always check `verified` first and leave verified records untouched.

This applies to the *reprocessing* path only. A full re-analysis (a folder-run rerun via `POST /api/folder-runs/{id}/rerun`, or re-analysing a deployment) deletes every detection under the parent and rebuilds from the JSON, so verified corrections do not survive it, by design: it is a "start over" operation, not an in-place update. The user-facing docs must not claim corrections survive a re-run of the AI; they survive threshold changes and reprocessing, not re-analysis. See "Deleting analysis data".
**An unclassified detection always carries its category's builtin taxonomy row.** The label filter tree and the "Select all" filter match on `label_taxonomy_id`, never on label text, so a box with no row is counted in the Detections tab and drawn in the grid but absent from the tree and from every filter that could reach it. `clear_classification` in `ml/taxonomy_db.py` is the one writer for "no species": the ingest, the phase 7 update and its exclusion sweep, a drawn box without a label, a PATCH that empties a label and revert-to-AI all go through it. Four of those used to null the row themselves, and the relink pass in the detection worker ran in phase 6, before phase 7 had cleared anything, so a fresh analysis with many excluded classes showed no "Animal" leaf at all (2026-09-06). The relink pass stays as a safety net and runs after phase 7. Pinned by the unclassified test in `tests/integration/test_postprocessing_pipeline.py` and the two in `tests/api/test_detections.py`.
