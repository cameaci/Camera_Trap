// Every row here is deliberate. The file can only teach through its data,
// because CSV has no comment syntax and an extra explaining column would be
// rejected as unrecognised. In order the rows show: a path containing a space
// with no quotes around it (the artifact that sends people to quote paths and
// then fail), a filled notes, the smallest row, the same site used again for a
// second period (so it is clear one site can hold many deployments), and an
// empty site, which is allowed and means the site is set later, and a paired
// deployment of dependent cameras, one subfolder per camera. The two tag:
// columns show that there can be several, each filled on some rows and
// empty on others.
//
// Every path ends in a deployment_NNN folder on purpose. A path like
// .../2026/river-crossing reads as a whole site's footage, which nudges people
// into pointing at one folder per site, and from there into listing a folder
// and its subfolders in the same file. One row is one camera period.
//
// The site names match the site example, so a user who runs both imports in
// order sees the link between the two files work.
