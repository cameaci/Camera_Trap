/**
 * "Show recent runs" — the step-1 re-entry list.
 *
 * A folder run persists its step, but the only way back into one used to be
 * remembering its folder and re-browsing to it. This lists recent runs so the
 * user can click straight back in.
 *
 * Clicking a row navigates to `/folder-runs/{id}`; the existing
 * FolderRunResumeIndex redirect drops the user on that run's persisted step —
 * no resume logic lives here.
 *
 * Runs whose folder has moved, been deleted, or sits on an unplugged drive
 * come back with `folder_exists: false`. Those are shown greyed and are not
 * resumable (there'd be nothing to open), but they can still be deleted —
 * which is exactly when you'd want to.
 *
 * Delete is irreversible: it takes the run's DB rows and its on-disk
 * `.addaxai` cache, so it sits behind a confirm naming the folder.
 *
 * The API returns every run, so the list starts at INITIAL_ROWS and the rest
 * are one click away. Nothing is hidden silently: a truncated list reads as
 * "these are your runs", and a user whose run is missing would reasonably
 * conclude it is gone and re-run work they already did. Since the full list is
 * already in the browser, revealing it in pages would buy nothing but clicks.

 * "how big is the folder". That makes it the signal for whether the run ran
 * at all, and it is why an unanalysed run reports no count: "0 files" would
 * describe the database, not the folder the user picked, which is full of
