/**
 * Step progress indicator for the folder-run stepper.
 *
 * Renders the steps as numbered chips. The current step is
 * highlighted, completed steps render with a check mark, upcoming
 * steps are muted.
 *
 * Step ordering is fixed: setup → labels → save.
 * "Completed" means a step preceding the current one.
 *
 * Direct navigation: before the analysis has run, only the current
 * step and steps already reached are clickable — jumping forward past
 * unfilled requirements (no models picked, no analysis run) lands the
 * user on a page that can't function. Once analysis has completed
 * (``furthest`` past "setup"), every step functions, so the whole row
 * unlocks and the user can hop freely between Setup, Labels, and Save.
 * When ``furthest`` isn't known yet (e.g. the brand-new-run path before
 * a run id exists) only the current step is interactive.
