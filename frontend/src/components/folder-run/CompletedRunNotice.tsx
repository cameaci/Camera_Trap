/**
 * Slim status row for the Setup step, shown when the folder run is
 * already in a terminal state (queue entry completed or failed) and
 * the user is still looking at its source folder.
 *
 * Sits where the standalone "Start analysis" button normally lives,
 * so the action area collapses to one row regardless of run state:
 *
 *   [ icon + status text ]                       [ Skip ] [ Re-run ]
 *
 * Two actions:
 * - **Skip analysis**: jump straight to Verification. Always the
 *   same destination so the mental model stays "skip or run again".
 * - **Re-run analysis**: open the destructive confirm dialog that
 *   wipes the analysis output and re-processes under the current
 *   form values.
 *
 * Metadata (file counts, verification progress, run date) lives on
 * the Verification / Summary / Output pages and inside the Re-run
 * destructive confirm dialog. We keep this row light because the
 * user is already inside the run and the destructive button has its
 * own confirm with the full breakdown.
