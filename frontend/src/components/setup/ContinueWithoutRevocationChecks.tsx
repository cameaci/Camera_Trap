/**
 * The opt-out offered when an environment build fails because Windows
 * could not check a certificate's revocation status.
 *
 * One component for both surfaces that can hit it (the first-run wizard
 * and model preparation), so the wording and the trade-off are stated
 * once and cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Clicking it records the choice on the backend and then retries. The
 * record is a file in the user's AddaxAI folder, so every later
 * environment build honours it too and the user is not asked again.
