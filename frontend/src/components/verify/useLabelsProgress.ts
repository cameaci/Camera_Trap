/**
 * The Labels page's progress, shared by both tabs and the dashboard.
 *
 * Counted in labels, where a label is one call a person has to make: a
 * detection above the threshold, which is one card in Detections, or a file
 * with nothing above it, one "nothing here" call. The two never overlap,
 * so 100% means every one has been looked at.
 *
 * The tab chips count in their own units: boxes left for Detections,
 * files not signed off for Files. Those two overlap, which is the point
 * of having two views of the work.
 *
 * One hook so the two tabs cannot show different numbers for the same
 * work. Switching tabs must not move the bar.
 *
 * Follows the site and date filters, which narrow what the user is
 * working on. It deliberately ignores the verified filter: a bar whose
 * denominator moves with the thing it measures can only ever read 0% or
 * 100%.
