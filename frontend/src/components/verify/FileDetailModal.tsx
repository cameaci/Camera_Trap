/**
 * Full-size view of one file, for the Files tab.
 *
 * Same frame as the Detections detail view (`VerifyDetailShell`): picture on
 * the left, what it is on the top right, what you can do on the bottom
 * right. A person is doing the same job in both, so they should not
 * have to learn two screens.
 *
 * Every visible box is drawn: above the threshold, or verified. The
 * sub-threshold boxes are not, and that is load-bearing: Verify says
 * "the boxes you can see are all there is", and the backend rejects the
 * ones you could not see (marked "false detection", like the X key).
 * Drawing them would make that verdict about a threshold instead of
 * about the picture.
 *
 * What you can do. **Verify** signs the file off and moves on; it is one
 * action because it is one decision. Draw a box on an animal the
 * detector missed: arm the crosshair with D or the button, drag, and the
 * species search opens on the new box by itself. Name a species in the
 * Default label card and new boxes take that instead, with nothing to
 * answer, which only pays off while drawing several of one thing.
 *
 * The label actions are the Detections grid's, with one scope rule: R,
 * X, U and the saved number-key labels act on the selected box, and on every
 * visible box when none is selected. The same rule decides what happens
 * next: a whole-picture action is the verdict, so it signs the file off
 * and advances in the same press (like the Detections viewer); a
 * selected-box action stays for the next box. Click a box or Tab through them to
 * select one; the buttons say which scope they are in. M relabels every
 * box to the picture's most common label, whatever is selected. Cmd+Z
 * reverts the last label change, as in the grid; a file verify (its own
 * scope of boxes) and a drawn box (no original label to go back to) are
 * not undoable.
 *
 * The left rail is the shared `ViewerToolRail`, the same one as the
 * Counts modal: brightness/contrast, hide boxes (B), flag (F), like,
 * download and open in file explorer, each a plain icon. One mental
 * model: the rail is how you look, the right column is what you
 * decide.
 *
 * A playable video can be watched: P or the play button swaps the kept
 * frame for the real clip with each frame's boxes (`VideoPlayer`, the
 * Counts modal's player, which honours B). The keys stay live and keep
 * acting on the kept frame's boxes, the only ones a verdict is about;
 * D returns to the frame and arms the crosshair, because a box can
 * only be drawn there. Download saves the annotated copy: the recorded
 * boxed MP4 for a playable video, the boxed still otherwise.
 *
 * The file deliberately stays put after a change. An earlier version
 * refetched the list immediately, so a file that stopped matching the
 * filter left the list and took the modal with it, which meant a box
 * could never be moved, resized or relabelled. The list is refreshed
 * when the modal closes instead.
 *
 * Signing off the last file on a page does not close it either. The tab
 * fetches the next batch and the run carries on, so 500 files is one
 * pass rather than ten passes of 48 with a reopen between each.

                  it is the only one written to disk as a JPEG.

                  The watch offer (the play button, P) shows the whole
                  clip with each frame's boxes, which is a better basis
                  for the Verify verdict than one still. The limit that

                  saved on the kept frame (`AnnotationCanvas` stamps
                  `best_frame_number` on every box it creates), so an
                  animal seen on another second is recorded by drawing
                  it on this frame. Worded to hold in every case,
