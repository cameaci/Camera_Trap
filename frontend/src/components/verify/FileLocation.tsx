 * The file's name in the Image card, with the way to it: the full path

 * file explorer. A user with many subfolders could not tell where to
 * look for the raw photo outside the app (Grant Hiebert, 2026-08-25).
 * The button only renders inside Electron, where opening the explorer
 * is possible; the event view offers the same action in its menu
 * through the same hook.

 * Shared by the Detections and Files large views so the two cards
