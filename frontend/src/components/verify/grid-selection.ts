/**
 * Selection behaviour shared by the two Labels grids.
 *
 * Detections selects boxes and Files selects files, but the gestures
 * are the same and a user should only have to learn them once:
 *
 *   click            select just this one, and put the anchor here
 *   shift + click    add the range between the anchor and this one,
 *                    leaving the anchor put so the range can be redrawn
 *   cmd / ctrl click toggle this one, and move the anchor here
 *   escape           clear
 *   click background clear
 *
 * Plus: after a bulk action consumes the selection, the card that slides
 * into the freed slot becomes selected, so a repeated action never needs
 * the mouse again.
 *
 * Both are pure functions over an ordered list of ids. They own the rules
 * and nothing else, so the two grids cannot drift apart, and neither one
 * has to know how the other stores its rows.
 *
 * Note what is deliberately absent: nothing is selected on load. The grid
 * opens with an empty selection and the first thing a user clicks decides
 * the anchor.
