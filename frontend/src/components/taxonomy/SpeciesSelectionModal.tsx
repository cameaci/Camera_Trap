/**
 * Species Selection Modal
 *
 * Modal dialog containing the SpeciesSelector tree for excluding species.
 * Opened from LabelSelectionField when the user wants to refine the included
 * labels by hand. Uses a working-copy pattern: changes are only applied on
 * "Apply". The country/geofence filter lives in LabelSelectionField, not here.
 *
 * Save / Load: the current selection can be written to a small JSON file the
 * user names and manages themselves (so they can keep one per region and share
 * it with colleagues), and loaded back later. The file stores the *included*
 * species (human-readable) plus the model id; loading converts back to the
 * internal exclusion set against the current model, so a species the file
 * doesn't mention becomes excluded and any label the current model lacks is
 * ignored. No preset store, no database — the files are the user's to own.

            didn't select, taxonomic rollup reports the nearest broader group
            you kept instead, for example its family. With rollup off it falls
            back to your next best species, usually with a very low score.
