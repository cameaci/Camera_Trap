// Screenshot manifest for the landing page and docs.
//
// Screenshots of the real app are committed as WebP under docs/static/img and
// referenced by local path below, so the docs are self-contained with no
// external CDN dependency. The source PNGs live in
// ~/Desktop/addaxai-docs-screenshots/upload (with a README mapping every file
// to its key here). To update a shot: re-export the PNG there, convert it to
// WebP (e.g. `magick in.png -quality 85 out.webp`), and drop it into
// static/img under the same filename.
//
// A src starting with "http" is used as-is; a local path is served from
// /static (see AppShot). All shots are 1440 px wide at 2x, light theme,
// expanded sidebar.
