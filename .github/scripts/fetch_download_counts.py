"""Snapshot GitHub release-asset download counts into a tidy CSV.

Run by the "Download metrics" workflow on a weekly schedule. GitHub's
``download_count`` is a live cumulative counter with no history, so we append a
dated row per asset to ``metrics/download_counts.csv`` to build a trend over
time.

Only releases from ``MIN_VERSION`` on are recorded, see the note there.

Stdlib only (no dependencies): reads ``GITHUB_REPOSITORY`` and ``GITHUB_TOKEN``
from the environment (both provided automatically inside GitHub Actions),
fetches every release + asset, and appends one row per asset for today's UTC
date. The header is written only when the CSV does not exist yet.

The CSV is tidy/long: ``snapshot_date,release_tag,asset_name,download_count``.
Each row is a running total, so week-over-week deltas give new downloads.
